2 medium ripe tomatoes
Salt
4 bulb onions or 8 scallions
2 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, sliced thin
2 cups fresh bread crumbs
 1/2 cup loosely packed basil leaves
 1/2 cup loosely packed flat parsley leaves
1 cup clam juice
 1/4 cup dry white wine
1 3-pound bluefish, filleted and cut in 4 portions, or 4 bluefish fillets, with skin, each about 6 ounces
Freshly ground black pepper.

1. Core tomatoes and slice  1/4-inch thick. Place on rack over baking sheet and salt generously on both sides. Set aside 1 hour.

2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. If using bulb onions, trim roots and leave about 4 inches of stem. Cut each in half lengthwise. If using scallions, trim roots and leave whole. Brush onions or scallions with  1/2 tablespoon oil. Place on baking sheet and roast until tender, about 20 minutes. Set aside.

3. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in small skillet, add garlic, sauté over low heat until barely golden, remove pan from heat and set aside.

4. Place crumbs, basil and parsley in food processor or blender and process until blended. In pan, bring clam juice and wine to a simmer and remove from heat. Increase oven heat to 500 degrees.

5. Using remaining oil, lightly oil baking dish that will hold bluefish in a single layer. Place bluefish fillets in dish skin side up. Place onions or scallions around fish. Place 2 to 3 slices tomato, slightly overlapping, on each fillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cover fish, tomatoes and onions generously with bread crumbs. Pour clam stock around fish and drizzle with garlic oil, with or without slices of garlic, on top. Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until just cooked through and lightly browned. Serve at once.

1 tablespoon unsalted butter at room temperature
2 slices bacon, about 2 oz finely chopped
1 large yellow onion, chopped
6 cups (48 fl oz) chicken stock

For the Toasted Walnut Butter:
3 tablespoons walnuts
2 teaspoons walnut oil
large pinch of sugar
salt and pepper
2 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature

1/4 cup heavy (double) cream
large pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
salt and pepper
flat-leaf parsley (garnish)

Preheat an oven to 375 F.  Lightly oil a baking sheet.

Cut each squash in half through the stem end and place, cut sides down, on the prepared baking sheet.  Bake until easily pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes.  Remove from the oven and set aside until cool enough to handle.

Using a spoon, scoop out the seeds and fibers and discard.  Spoon the flesh into a bowl and set aside.  Leave the oven set at 375.

In a soup pot over medium heat, melt the butter (1 T).  Add the bacon and onion and saute until the onion is soft, about 10 minutes.  Raise the heat to high, add the squash and stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until the squash disintegrates, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the walnut butter: In a small bowl, toss together the walnuts, walnut oil, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste and spread out on a baking sheet.  Toast until golden brown, 5-7 minutes.  Remove from the oven, let cool and chop finely.  In a small bowl, using a fork, mash together the walnuts and butter (2 T).  Spoon out the butter onto a piece of plastic wrap, shape into a log about 1 inch in diameter.  Wrap and refrigerate until serving.  (Or just leave it in the bowl and scoop some out later. :) )

Remove the squash from the heat and let it cool for 20 minutes.  Using a blender and working in batches, puree the soup on high speed until smooth, 2-3 minutes.  Pass through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean saucepan. (I skipped the sieving and it was still great.)  Add the cream, nutmeg, orange juice, and salt and pepper to taste.  Reheat to serving temperature and ladle into warmed bowls.  Cut (or scoop) the walnut butter into 6 equal slices and float a slice in each bowl.  Garnish with parsley leaves and serve hot.

(You might be tempted to omit the walnut butter ... don't, it's worth the effort.)$$,1,@cat9,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2004-02-25', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

8 ounces pork sausage breakfast links (about 16 sausages)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/4 cups milk
4 large eggs
Scant 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour.

1. Heat oven to 450 degrees. Place sausages in a baking dish about 9 inches square by 3 inches deep. Rub sausages with oil, and oil bottom and sides of pan as well. Bake until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, whisk together milk, eggs and salt in a mixing bowl, and set aside. When sausages are nearly ready, add flour to milk mixture and mix until smooth.

3. Transfer sausages to a plate and set aside. Pour just enough batter into hot pan to cover the bottom. Return to oven and bake until batter is set, about 5 minutes. Arrange sausages evenly across top of batter, and quickly pour in rest of batter.

4. Return pan to oven and bake until batter billows up around sausages and has a crusty top, about 25 minutes. Cut into squares and serve immediately, because the crust will sink as it cools.

- 6 to 7 cups chicken stock or reduced-sodium and fat chicken broth, divided
- 1 can (16 ounces) whole tomatoes, undrained, broken into pieces
- 1 can (16 ounces) stewed tomatoes, undrained, broken into pieces
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- Optional: ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- Optional: ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup coarsely chopped parsley
- 2 teaspoons filé powder (<a href=\"#notes\">see note ***</a>)

1. Cut chicken thighs and breasts into about 1-inch pieces and season with 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning. Cut sausage in half lengthwise, then crosswise into ¼-inch thick slices. In a heavy-bottomed 6-quart pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add sausage, brown and remove from pan with a slotted spoon. Quickly brown the chicken pieces in 2 batches and remove from pan. Then add onion, bell pepper, celery and garlic; sauté until the vegetables begin to soften, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.

2. Whisk flour into the oil. Cook 15 to 20 minutes, whisking every few minutes. Watch carefully and reduce heat if necessary. The finished color of the roux should be a rich medium brown, almost the color of milk chocolate. Whisk in wine, 6 cups broth, all of the undrained tomatoes, Worcestershire, 1 tablespoon Cajun spice and the sautéed vegetables. Partially cover pot and simmer slowly, stirring often, for 40 minutes.

3. Stir chicken and sausage into the gumbo. Simmer, partially covered, 1 hour. Stir often to prevent gumbo sticking to the bottom of the pot. Taste and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper if necessary. Stir in parsley and filé powder, remove from heat and set aside 5 minutes. Add a little more broth to thin the gumbo if needed.

1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/4 teaspoon whole cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
1 whole chicken, about 3 to 4 pounds.

This looked like it would make way too much sauce so I changed some amounts:
1/4 pound guajillo
<1/8 chipotle
1/8 pulla
2 medium tomatoes
1 large onion

The sauce was good.  I ended up with ~4 cups of sauce.  I also found that the cooking time was underestimated.  (I needed ~20 min more.)

1. Remove seeds and stems from all chilies. Place chilies in a large pot, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, and cook until softened, 20 minutes. Drain and purée in food processor, adding a little orange juice or water to make a sauce. Gradually add tomatoes, onions and garlic to processor. Add remaining ingredients except chicken and remaining orange juice or water. Strain sauce well. Taste and add salt if needed.

2. Place chicken in a bowl, and pour 1 cup marinade over it and inside cavity. (There will be more marinade than you need; excess can be refrigerated up to a week and used with leftovers.) Marinate for 30 minutes, or overnight in refrigerator.

3. When ready to roast chicken, heat oven to 350 degrees. Roast 40 to 45 minutes, basting every 20 minutes. Let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Serve as is or in enchiladas or tacos.

4. While carrots cook, place an ovenproof skillet that will hold duck in a single layer over medium-high heat. Add duck skin-side down; when it starts to sizzle, turn pieces, place skillet in oven, and roast until duck is crisp and browned, 20 to 25 minutes.

5. When carrots finish cooking, dust with sugar, increase heat, and cook until they start to caramelize. Add 2 tablespoons duck or chicken jus, season with additional salt and pepper if necessary, fold in parsley and lemon juice, and remove from heat.

6. When duck is done, place on a plate and cover. Pour excess fat from skillet, add carrot juice and remaining duck or chicken jus, and cook briefly, stirring, until sauce is syrupy.

7. Reheat carrot mixture, and divide among four warm dinner plates. Place a portion of confit on carrots, baste duck with a little sauce, drizzle rest around, then serve.

4 duck legs, trimmed of excess fat
Salt and pepper to taste
1 large onion
 1/2 pound carrots
3 celery stalks
2 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade.

1. Put duck legs, skin side down, in a skillet large enough to accommodate all ingredients comfortably; turn heat to medium. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Brown duck legs carefully and evenly, sprinkling them with salt and pepper as they cook. Meanwhile, peel and dice vegetables. 

 2. When legs are nicely browned, turn them over and sear for just a minute or two. Remove to a plate; remove all but enough fat to moisten vegetables. Add vegetables to skillet along with some salt and pepper. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until they begin to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Return duck legs to pan, skin side up, and add stock; it should come about halfway up duck legs but should not cover them. Turn heat to high, bring to a boil, and transfer to oven.

3. Cook for 30 minutes, then lower heat to 350 degrees. Continue to cook, undisturbed, until duck is tender and liquid reduced, at least another half hour. The duck is done when a thin-bladed knife pierces the meat with little resistance. When done, duck will hold nicely in a warm oven for another hour. Serve hot.

Raise heat and allow to boil for 5 minutes. Reduce heat until syrup is at a lively simmer. Add peach halves and poach just until lightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes on each side depending on ripeness of fruit. Using a slotted spoon, transfer peaches to a plate, reserving the syrup.

2. Allow peaches to cool. Peel, and discard any remaining pits. Peaches may be placed in a container, topped with syrup and refrigerated for up to 24 hours; gently reheat in syrup before serving. (Syrup may be saved and frozen for future use.)

3. Prepare raspberry sauce: In the bowl of a food processor, combine raspberries, confectioners' sugar and lemon juice. Process until smooth. Pour through a fine strainer to remove seeds and transfer sauce to a small pitcher.

4. To assemble, place a scoop or two of ice cream on each of four serving plates. Place two peach halves on each plate and drizzle with a small amount of raspberry sauce. Pass remaining sauce at the table.

Barbecue? You Could Do It in Your Sleep
By SAM SIFTON


CHRIS SCHLESINGER was snoring softly on the couch. This was in the living room of his sprawling ranch house here in southeastern Massachusetts, nestled high above a pebbly beach. A Bill Murray movie was playing on the television in the corner, and the cool breeze sliding off Buzzards Bay had dampened the room, covering the warmth of the day. Outside on the sweeping deck, in a giant ovoid kettle grill, three pork butts sat in the smoky braise of a small oak fire, glistening, ruddy, plump. It was well after midnight. Seven hours' cooking done. Seven hours to go.

The snoring came to an abrupt stop as someone in the room moved to open a sliding door and go check the fire.

\"Barbecue Man may appear to be asleep,\" Mr. Schlesinger roared, climbing off the couch. \"But Barbecue Man is always awake and in control!\"

He padded barefoot to the deck and placed his palm on the covered grill. \"Barbecue is such a typical guy thing to do,\" he said. \"Much ado about nothing.\" He lifted the kettle top and a cloud of fragrant, oaky smoke engulfed him. He laughed from within it. \"But it is intense.\"

Mr. Schlesinger, 47, is the chef and an owner of the East Coast Grill in Cambridge, Mass., which he opened in 1985. He is also the author, with John Willoughby, of six cookbooks that relate somehow to the pleasures of fire. (Two others celebrate pickles and lettuce, respectively.)

Their latest, \"Let the Flames Begin\" (Norton), was published in 2002 and rereleased this year. There is an electric stove in his kitchen, which he rarely uses. He prefers to cook outside.

The plan was to make an American holiday meal, or at least the part that could be made on a grill, overnight, for lunchtime celebration the following day. The menu: North Carolina-style pulled pork sandwiches, with their characteristic vinegary sauce, on cheap hamburger buns. You might accompany these with a simple preparation of coleslaw or some salad and a load of cut watermelon.

To make the sandwiches, you simply pull -- or tear, really -- shreds of meat from slow-roasted shoulder of hog, which is known among butchers and barbecue aficionados as pork butt, and place these on a bun with some sauce. (A hog's rear quarters are called, conversely and somewhat more attractively, hams.) The cooking time for the pork may exceed 12 hours, but you could start after work tomorrow and easily be done in time for a Fourth of July lunch with little effort beyond getting up a few times in the night to tend the fire. (For those leery of sleeping while fire burns bright, the meat could be cooked throughout the day and enjoyed as a late dinner about the same time the holiday fireworks wrap up, or even refrigerated until the following day, to be reheated in the oven.)

Mr. Schlesinger's fire started slowly. About 6 p.m., he poured a pile of hardwood charcoal about the size of a large box of cereal into the front of the grill's firebox and added to it a generous, unapologetic spray of lighter fluid. \"I don't have a problem with this stuff,\" he said. \"I want to get my fire going.\" When gray ash began to appear on the edges of the charcoal, he placed on it a large piece of dry oak, which popped and crackled in the heat.

Mr. Schlesinger's grill is a Weber Ranch kettle a yard across. Behind the fire was almost two feet of open grill space, plenty for the three pork butts he planned to cook. (A conventional grill has less space, but plenty for a single butt.) The meat would cook slowly in heat that would not often, Mr. Schlesinger estimated, exceed 212 degrees. \"You want to melt the fat into the meat,\" he said. \"You don't want to incinerate it.\"

To protect the butts during the cooking, Mr. Schlesinger used a dry rub of spices that adhered to the pork and seized up in the heat, creating a flavorful crust. To make it, he mixed generous amounts of brown sugar, dry mustard, ground coriander, cumin, cayenne, paprika, chili pepper, freshly ground black pepper and sea salt in a bowl.

When he was finished he set the rub aside and pulled the pork from his refrigerator.

\"There's no extra benefit in letting this meat come to room temperature before cooking it,\" he said. \"I don't like to take chances with bacteria.\" He cut the butts out of their packaging with a small knife and rinsed the meat in the kitchen sink. \"Likewise,\" he explained.

Outside, the charcoal fire was dying down and the oak smoking furiously. Mr. Schlesinger placed the three butts in a large disposable aluminum-foil pan on a table next to the grill and, using his hands, slathered them with the dry rub.

\"It's O.K. if it's a little wet,\" he said. \"It gets pasty, and that helps spread the rub around.\"

One by one he placed the butts on the grill, fatty side down, well away from the fire. \"I'll turn them later,\" he said. \"In about eight hours.\" He slid the kettle top onto the grill and adjusted the top vents. Smoke rose into the air from them in a steady stream.

\"It's running a little hot,\" Mr. Schlesinger said. \"But the one time you're not going to be overcooking a butt is now, at the beginning.\" He looked down at the smoke for a while, silently watching it rise.

\"Let's get some dinner,\" he said.

Mr. Schlesinger checked his fire again at 9:30 p.m., adding another piece of oak, and then retreated to the living room with a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon to watch television. \"Groundhog Day,\" the 1993 movie in which Mr. Murray experiences the same day over and over, had started on TBS at 8 o'clock. This morphed, at 10:20, into \"Ghostbusters\" (1984), in which Mr. Murray plays a parapsychology professor with a ghost-removal business. (Mr. Schlesinger added another log to the fire at 11:40.) \"Stripes,\" the 1981 movie in which an unemployed Mr. Murray joins the Army to meet girls and have a good time, got under way at 12:35 a.m. An hour later, Mr. Schlesinger reluctantly abandoned the narrative to add more charcoal to the fire, at which point he turned the butts over. More charcoal went on just after 3 a.m. On the television, \"Ghostbusters\" was playing again.

Between these chores, Mr. Schlesinger said, it only appeared that he was dozing.

At 8 a.m., with the sun beginning to dry the dew that had gathered on the deck during the night, Mr. Schlesinger declared the cooking complete, 14 hours after it had begun. \"Feel that,\" he said, pressing his finger into one of the butts. It felt like a ripe peach, or a late-summer tomato. \"Done,\" he said.

With tongs in his left hand and using his right hand for balance, moving carefully so as not to tear the skin, he pulled the butts, which now had the color and texture of redwood logs, off the grill and placed them back in the disposable aluminum-foil pan, which he had cleaned the night before.

\"We'll let those rest,\" he said, and went to the kitchen to get the sauce: a cup of white vinegar, a cup of cider vinegar, a tablespoon of sugar and a not inconsiderable dash of Tabasco sauce, mixed together in a bowl.

\"We'll let those butts rest all morning,\" Mr. Schlesinger continued. \"They'll be perfect for lunch.\"

But he soon pulled some hamburger buns out of a plastic bag and moved back to the porch. With his tongs, he picked up the largest of the butts by one end. It tore under its own weight, releasing a small cloud of steam. The smell was incomparable: sweet, smoky and fine.

He tore off a sliver of meat and tasted it, then smiled.

\"I was a little nervous,\" Mr. Schlesinger said. \"You always get nervous, even when you know it's going to be good.\"

He pulled some more meat off the butt and placed it on a bun. Breakfast was served.

Chops:

- ½ cup kosher salt
- 4 cups water
- 4 boneless pork loin chops, about ¾-inch thick
- 3 tablespoons flour
- 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- About 2 tablespoons olive oil

Sauce:

- ½ cup water
- 2 teaspoons Lapsang Souchong tea leaves (2 tea bags)
- ½ ounce dried porcini mushrooms
- ½ cup rich chicken broth, heated
- 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons apricot preserves
- 1 medium clove garlic, peeled and minced
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon coarsely chopped Italian parsley

1. To prepare chops: Combine salt and water in a large bowl; stirring to dissolve the salt. (Kosher salt dissolves more quickly than table salt.) Add chops to the brine. Place a small plate right on top of the pork to keep them submerged. Refrigerate 2 hours or longer.

2. Begin preparation for the sauce: Bring ½ cup water to a boil. Pour over tea leaves and let steep 5 minutes. Rinse dried mushrooms briefly to flush away dirt and put into a bowl. Strain tea over mushrooms; stir in hot chicken broth. Set aside 25 minutes, or until mushrooms have softened. Strain, reserving mushrooms and broth separately.

3. Whisk apricot preserves into the mushroom broth and set aside. Squeeze excess moisture out of mushrooms, chop coarsely and set aside with garlic.

4. Drain pork chops. Place on a plate lined with several paper towels, top with more paper towels and pat lightly to absorb excess moisture. Heat a heavy 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge pork in flour and sprinkle with pepper. Add 1 tablespoon oil to pan and heat. Put 2 to 4 chops into pan and cook without moving 4 minutes. Turn and cook 4 minutes longer, or until cooked through. Remove chops to a warm oven. If all of chops didn't fit in the pan, repeat with remaining oil and chops. Transfer to the oven.

5. Put mushrooms and garlic into pan, stirring 30 seconds. Deglaze pan with mushroom liquid mixture, stirring to loosen browned juices on bottom. Cook at a high simmer 3 to 4 minutes. Pour any juices that have accumulated around pork into pan with lemon juice. Continue to simmer 2 minutes, or until lightly thickened. Season with pepper and pour over chops.

August 7, 2002
By MARK BITTMAN 

JUST about everyone over 30 grew up eating cold noodles in the form of macaroni salad. Then the pasta police declared cold pasta beneath people of good taste, and from then on cold pasta dared show its face only at bad salad bars. Of course, closet eaters of leftover pasta (I'm one) are probably still in the majority, but that would be difficult to prove. 

Not all cuisines frown on eating noodles cold, however, and in Japan, where it gets plenty hot in the summer, cold soba noodles, served with a dipping sauce, are a common snack or light meal. Soba are brown noodles, made from wheat and buckwheat, and the sauce is based on dashi, the omnipresent
Japanese stock. 

You would recognize the smell of dashi in an instant, even if you have never knowingly eaten it. It's a brilliant concoction based on kelp, a seaweed and dried bonito flakes. It is also among the fastest and easiest stocks you can make, and its two main ingredients - which you can buy in any store specializing in Asian foods - keep indefinitely in your pantry. I would encourage you to try making it, though you can also use chicken stock (or
instant dashi, which is sold in the same stores). 

To make dashi, immerse about a four-inch piece of kelp in two cups of water and warm over medium heat for about 10 minutes. Remove the kelp just as the water is about to boil and add a handful - about half a cup - of bonito flakes. Turn off the heat, then let the mixture sit for about two minutes. Then strain it, and that's your dashi. For this dish, you will want to chill the sauce, or at least cool it. 

As for the noodles, the Japanese have their own method of cooking them, one in which cold water is added to the pot as the noodles cook. My guess is that this method evolved as a way to avoid overcooking, but as long as you are
attentive, it should not be a problem. 

And one nice thing about this and other cold noodle dishes is that when you judge that the noodles are done, you stop the cooking immediately by running them under cold water.

Start with sauteing some chopped onion.  Then add some smashed garlic and chopped celery and carrot, but not too much carrot as it seems to make the soup too sweet, unless you think that sounds okay.

Then when this is cooked sort of al dente (you can add a little water to keep everything from sticking to the pan), add a lot of chopped or shredded cabbage, possibly twice as much as you think you might need, and enough water to keep the whole business going.  The cabbage cooks down a lot. But don't over cook it.

Then add a can or two of diced canned tomatoes, a can or two of cooked dry beans, whatever appeals to you in way of flavor and color, a bouillon cube, some salt and pepper, basil, oregano, parsley, maybe a bit of cumin.  I usually swish the cans out with a bit of water and add that to the pot.

Then put in some V-8 juice, probably enough to thin the soup out to the thickness you want.  And simmer the mess together for a short time, enough to get everyone well acquainted, but not enough to overcook anything.  Like most soups, this will probably taste better prepared one day and eaten the next.  You may want to thin it out some more with water or V-8.  I usually make it fairly concentrated for freezing and then add water when I heat it up to eat.

You can also add other vegs, zucchini, summer squash, spinach, green beans, mushrooms, those skinny little eggplants, greens, fresh or frozen or  left-over, what else sounds good?  Maybe a bit of corn, although it seems to me that corn in soups is usually sort of tough.  If appropriate you can saute your vegs with the onions, cabbage, etc.  Just don't overcook them.  Very tender vegs like peas and zucchini hardly need any cooking at all.
I think the secret\" to this soup is the V-8 and the cabbage.  They contribute most of the flavor to the broth. 

Seth likes this served with grated parmesan cheese.  You could also throw in some cooked rice, cooked pasta (which tends to really soak up broth) or tortellini.  Or some cooked meat.  I've put in leftover chicken or pot roast at times.

To make the potatoes look a little more swank, cut them in half the \"wrong\" way, turning the shells on their ends to form little cups. And since the rich and creamy mashed-potato filling is what this side dish is all about, bake an extra potato so you'll have enough to pile it above the skins.

4 very large russet potatoes, each about 1 pound
4 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup crème fraîche or cultured sour cream
1/2 cup Fontina Val d'Aosta
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees and scrub the potatoes. Cut about half an inch off each end of each potato. (This will provide a level base for the potato to \"stand up\" when it's filled and rebaked.)

2. Bake the potatoes in the middle of the oven until they are tender, about one hour and 15 minutes.

3. When the potatoes are done, pull them out of the oven and turn it up to 400. Cut them in half crosswise so that you have two tall halves that will stand on the ends you trimmed. With a tablespoon, scoop the insides from the potato halves, preserving enough of the white flesh against the skin to keep the \"cups\" stable. Select the six halves that look best for filling and discard the two others. (The extra potato is there to provide more filling for the six that you will serve.)

4. Add the butter to the potatoes in the bowl and mash with a wire whisk. Whisk in the crème fraîche and half the Fontina, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Arrange the filled potatoes in a small baking dish crimping foil around their bases to keep them upright, or push them into the cups of a muffin tin. Press the remaining cheese on top of the potatoes. (Note: the potatoes may be prepared ahead up to this point and refrigerated to be baked off later.)

16 oz. peeled tomatoes (canned, fresh or frozen)
1/2 to 1 med. onion
48 oz. (total) beans:  dark red kidney, black and/or pinto
1/3 C. chopped jalapeno peppers*
23 oz. tomato sauce
4 oz. canned chopped green chilies (do not drain)
2 T. plus 1 tsp. cumin
2 T. chili powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. oregano
1/4 tsp. cayenne (red) pepper
1/4 tsp. black pepper


 All spice measurements should be heaping.

First brown the meat until it is very done.  While it is cooking, chop the tomatoes and onion. Drain and rinse the beans.  The ingredients just chopped along with the meat, drained beans, jalapeno peppers and tomato sauce can be mixed in a crock pot or kettle (a large wok will work).  After these have been mixed, add the green chilies and the spices, stirring well.  Add water to barely cover, then place lid on pot and set the heat so the chili-to-be is almost but not quite boiling.  Cook it for about 4 hours, stirring occasionally.	

*If the jalapeno peppers are fresh, they add color, but it isn't vital.  The \"alarm value\" can be adjusted by changing the amount of jalapeno peppers.

Time: 5 hours 45 minutes

1 pound yellow onions, peeled and coarsely chopped
 1/2 stick unsalted butter, melted
1 5-pound duck, rinsed and patted dry
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
2 large rosemary sprigs
2 cups fresh orange juice
1 cup dry sherry
 1/2 cup soy sauce
2 medium carrots, peeled and julienned
4 ounces cremini or white button mushrooms, trimmed and sliced thin
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 7-ounce jar roasted red peppers, rinsed, drained and cut into strips
2 fresh chives, cut into 1-inch lengths
Hash browns (see recipe, linked at right).

1. Heat oven to 500 degrees. In a large bowl, toss onions with melted butter. Season duck inside and out with salt and pepper. Place rosemary sprigs inside duck's cavity and then tightly pack with buttered onion mixture.

2. Place duck in medium-size roasting pan, and roast for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees and cover pan loosely with foil. Roast for about 4 1/2 hours, draining fat every hour.

3. Remove pan from oven and carefully discard as much fat as possible with a ladle. Add orange juice, sherry and soy sauce. Return pan to oven and roast uncovered for 30 minutes. Transfer duck to a platter and let cool slightly. Pour pan juices (about 4 cups) into a saucepan, discarding any pieces of skin. Skim off fat and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add carrots and reduce to 1 1/2 cups, strain and keep on the side. In same pan, sauté mushrooms with 2 tablespoons butter until brown. Add red peppers and briefly sauté, then add reduced sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm over low heat.

4. Remove onions and rosemary from duck's cavity. Remove meat from bones. Place skin from duck breasts onto cookie sheet and bake at 400 degrees until skin starts to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 200 degrees and place meat in oven to keep warm until serving.

5. Cover bottoms of individual plates with sauce and top with either pasta, shoestring fries, hash browns or unsalted potato chips. Place a generous amount of duck meat on top, then garnish with crispy skin, vegetables and chives.

1/4 cup sour cream
1/4 cup cider vinegar (I thought 1/4 cup made the dressing a bit too vinegary)
1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese of your choice
1/2 cup olive oil
Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste

<i>For the Wings</i>:
3 pounds medium-size chicken wings
2 tablesppons Sherwood or other good-quality curry powder (see below)
Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste

<i>For the Buffalo Sauce</i>:
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/4 to 1/2 cup hot sauce of your choice (like Tabasco)
3 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano or marjoram
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
1/4 cup olive oil
Juice of 2 limes
4 cucumbers, peeled and cut length-wise into spears

1. Build a multi-level fire in your grill:  Leaving one-quarter of the bottom free of coals, bank the coals in the remaining three-quarters of the frill so that they are three times as hight on one side as on the other.  When the coals are all igniited and the temperature has died down to medium (you can hold your hand about 5 inches above the grill grid, over the area where the coals are deepest, for 4 to 5 seconds), you're ready to cook.

2. In a food processor or blender, combine the sour cream, vinegar, and blue cheese and process until smooth.  With the machine running, add the oil through the feed tube in a thin stream; the dressing should become thick and creamy.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Transfer the dressing to a small bowl, cover, and regrigerate.

3. Cut the wings into 3 sections (or just buy the drummettes).  Discard the wing tips or save them to use in stock.  Rub the remaining wing sections with the curry powder and sprinkle them generously with salt and pepper.  Place them on the grill and cook, turning occasionally, until they are golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes.  To check for doneness, nick, peek, and cheat:  Cut into one of the wings and peek to be sure there is no redness near the bone.

4. While the wings are cooking, combine all the ingredients for the Buffalo sauce in a bowl large enough to hold all the chicken.  As the wings come off the grill, drop them in the sauce and turn to coat.

5. Serve the wings right out of the bowl or on a big platter, accompanied by the blue cheese dressing for dipping and the cucumber spears to cool things off.

A Lot Tastier Than a Jack-o'-Lantern
By NIGELLA LAWSON

THERE is something about the bulging brightness of a pumpkin that is fabulously compelling. Just seeing pumpkins piled high in the stores fills me with harvest festival spirit. I do not have anything against a gloriously spooky Halloween pumpkin, but I've always felt it was a pity to use this fruit for decoration alone.

Pumpkin soups there are aplenty, and I make them often at this time of year. I'm fond of a roasted wedge in place of potatoes, too. But I knew it was possible to cook the whole pumpkin, to make a proper meal of it stuffed with rice and spices and dried fruit.

I have been dying to do this for some time but thought an altogether different person  someone less clumsy  was the sort to scrape out pumpkins, stuff them and bake them. I also suspected I was too lazy for this work, but the strange truth is that the recipe here is one of the simplest you can imagine. And the result is magisterial, beautiful and inviting.

The quantity of rice specified in the recipe is what I needed for the pumpkin I stipulate, but I should say two things here. One is that you might not find (or want) a pumpkin of exactly the same weight. The other is that different pumpkins have different-size cavities. The easiest way to find out how much rice you need is as follows:

When you have cut the top off and scraped out the seeds, take a plastic freezer bag and line the cavity with it. Pour rice into the bag to about halfway up the cavity, then pour out the rice into a measuring cup. Double the measurement to determine how much stock or water to cook the rice in. The plastic liner is not a hygiene thing: it is just that if you don't use it, you will spend ages scraping out the rice. I know whereof I speak.

The result is beautiful, whole and oven-scorched. It is very gratifying to slice through the pumpkin and hand out glorious coral-fleshed, rice-nubbly wedges to a tableful of hungry guests. The pumpkin's skin softens enough as it bakes, making cutting easy.

I like to eat this dish just as it is  it makes a warm, welcoming meal after a chilly evening of trick-or-treating  but it is also very good with a tomato sauce poured over each slice as you serve. To make the sauce, you need do no more than finely chop an onion and soften it in a little oil in a pan. Then mince in a clove of garlic, add a can or two of chopped canned tomatoes, a teaspoon of sugar and salt and a grinding of pepper, and cook for 20 minutes until everything has amalgamated into a thick red sauce. Sometimes I add half a teaspoon of ground ginger to it along with the garlic. Sometimes I throw in an inch of fresh garlic, removing it once the sauce is cooked.

With or without the sauce, this is a fine meal, worth bearing in mind to serve at Thanksgiving if you have vegetarians at your table: it is quite as spectacularly celebratory as a roast turkey.

The cookies here have none of the pumpkin's autumnal majesty, but Halloween is not one of the most dignified of festivals. These monster cookies, studded with colored candies (delicious if they are peanut-filled, too), are an amazing way to end a grown-up supper, and a very useful way to keep a roomful of boisterous children happy.$$,1,@cat4,@subcat8,PARSEDATETIME('2004-10-29', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Salt and pepper
1 pound Italian sausage, preferably bulk or ground meat of any type, or a combination
1 large onion, diced
1 tablespoon minced garlic, optional
1 28-ounce can tomatoes, chopped, with liquid 
1 pound ziti or other large cut pasta
1 pound mozzarella, grated or chopped
Olive oil or butter as needed
 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, optional.

1. Bring large pot of water to boil; salt it. Heat oven to 400 degrees.

2. Distribute meat in large skillet over medium high heat and cook, undisturbed, until browned on one side, about 5 minutes. Stir, cook another 2 minutes undisturbed, then add the onion and garlic, if using. Lower heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft; add tomatoes and bring to a boil. Simmer while cooking pasta, stirring and seasoning with salt and pepper to taste; do not let sauce become too thick. 

3. Cook pasta until just tender; it should still be too hard to eat. Drain it (do not shake the colander; allow some water to cling to the noodles) and toss it with the sauce and half the mozzarella. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and spoon mixture into it. Top with remaining mozzarella and the Parmesan if using. Bake until top is browned and cheese bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes.

Time: 2 1/2 to 3 hours

1 10- to 12-pound turkey, brined (see below)

2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter.

1. Set up an outdoor grill for indirect grilling, placing a large foil drip pan in center. (If using a smoker, light and set it up according to manufacturer's instructions and heat to 275 degrees. In a smoker, you will need to cook bird longer, 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours.)

2. Drain bird. Blot dry inside and out and truss if desired. Place in center of grill grate, over drip pan and between mounds of natural lump charcoal. Toss  1/2 cup of soaked wood chops on each mound of coals. Place lid on grill. Adjust vents to keep temperature between 325 and 350 degrees.

3. Grill turkey until darkly browned and cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Baste turkey with melted butter after first hour and every hour thereafter. If skin starts to brown too much, loosely tent bird with foil. Use an instant-read thermometer to test for doneness; turkey is ready when internal temperature of the thigh is 180 degrees. Replenish charcoal every hour, adding 8 to 10 lumps of charcoal to each mound of coals and leaving grill uncovered for a few minutes to allow charcoal to light. After 1 hour, add 1 1/2 cups of soaked wood chips.

4. Transfer turkey to a platter, loosely tent with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes before carving. Reserve any drippings in drip pan for gravy.

Yield: 10 to 12 servings.

For the crust:
2 cups all-purpose flour
14 tablespoons (1¾ sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 tablespoon cold vegetable shortening
Scant ½ teaspoon salt
Scant ½ teaspoon sugar
1 egg

For the filling:
5 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup chopped carrot
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup thinly sliced leeks
1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
1 cup frozen baby green peas
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2½ cups chicken broth
1 cup heavy cream
Salt and freshly ground pepper
3 cups leftover roast chicken, cut into ½-inch chunks.

1. To make the crust, combine flour, butter, shortening, salt and sugar in a food processor. Pulse together just until the mixture is crumbly and butter is broken into small pieces. Pour 1/3 cup ice water into the machine, and pulse 3 or 4 times. Squeeze a little dough in your hand to see whether it clumps together and is evenly moist. If not, add another tablespoon of water, and pulse 1 or 2 times more. Don't overmix so that the dough forms a ball.

2. Turn out dough on a large sheet of plastic wrap. Lift ends of plastic to gather dough together inside. Press into a large disk, and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use, up to 2 days.

3. To make the filling, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrot, celery, leeks and tarragon, and cook, stirring, just until slightly softened but not browned (reduce the heat if necessary to prevent browning), about 3 minutes. Transfer cooked vegetables to a bowl, wipe out the skillet, and place it back on the stove.

4. Add remaining 3 tablespoons butter, and melt over medium heat. Whisk in flour, and cook, whisking, until the mixture bubbles and smells cooked. Do not let it brown. Whisk in 2 cups broth, and cook, whisking, 1 minute. Whisk in cream, and cook 2 or 3 minutes, just until thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If the sauce is too thick, whisk in remaining broth.

5. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Add cooked vegetables and peas, chicken and sauce to 8-ounce deep pie dish or other baking dish, mix gently, and taste for seasoning.

6. Flour a work surface. Remove dough from refrigerator, and cut in half. (Set aside half for another recipe.) Roll out remaining dough, turning and flouring often, and cut a shape approximately the size of your baking dish plus 1½ inches overlap all around.

7. Whisk egg in a small bowl. Brush onto rim of dish. Roll dough up onto the rolling pin, and unroll over dish, so it rests evenly on top of filling. Press overlap onto the rim and against the outside of the dish, sealing tightly. Poke tip of knife through crust to create 3 vent holes near the center. Place on cookie sheet, and place in oven.

8. Bake 20 minutes, then reduce temperature to 375 degrees. Bake 15 to 20 minutes more, until crust is golden and filling is bubbling through vents. Let rest 10 minutes before serving.

INSERT INTO RECIPE (ID, TITLE, BODY, OWNER_ID, CATEGORY_ID, SUB_CATEGORY_ID, DATE_CREATED, VERSION) VALUES (seq_recipe.nextval, $$Meyer Lemon-Ricotta Ravioli$$, $$Adapted from Andrew Feinberg

Time: 80 minutes, plus 30 minutes to rest dough

For pasta dough (see note):
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
6 large fresh egg yolks
Semolina or cornmeal for dusting

For filling:
1 ½ cups fresh ricotta cheese
1/3 cup (1 ounce) freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon finely grated Meyer lemon zest
10 turns freshly ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon kosher salt

For sauce:
12 tablespoons (1 ½ sticks) unsalted butter
2 tablespoons finely grated Meyer lemon zest
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving.

1. Put flour and salt in a large bowl. Add yolks, and use a fork to mix them into the flour. Turn dough out onto a floured surface, and knead for about 8 minutes or until dough is smooth. If dough seems sticky, add up to 2 tablespoons more flour. Knead dough a few times by hand to form an elastic ball, wrap it in plastic, and let rest for a half-hour.

2. Stir together all ingredients for filling.

3. Set up a pasta roller, and spread a large work surface with kitchen towels. Divide dough in thirds, and pass each through widest setting twice. Reduce roller width one setting, and again run each piece of dough through twice. Continue through each setting until all three pieces of dough have gone through rollers at narrowest setting (No. 7 on most pasta machines). As you work lay sheets of pasta on towels, covering them with more towels to keep them moist.

4. To fill ravioli, place a teaspoonful of filling at 1½-inch intervals about 1 inch from edge of one length of dough. Dip a pastry brush in water, and brush dough around filling, moistening all the way to edges. Fold dough lengthwise over filling, and press around each scoop, pushing out any air and sealing ravioli. Use a crimped pasta wheel cutter (or press down with blade of a serrated knife) to slice through dough halfway between each scoop of filling, then trim edges to create 2-inch squares. Press edges to seal completely. Dust finished ravioli with semolina or cornmeal. Cover with a kitchen towel and refrigerate for up to 1 day if not using immediately.

5. For sauce, melt butter in a large skillet with lemon zest and salt and pepper to taste.

6. To cook ravioli, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli and cook just until very al dente, about 2 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or skimmer to scoop ravioli into a colander. Measure 2/3 cup pasta cooking water and gradually whisk it into butter sauce until it is smooth and creamy. Add ravioli, toss to coat with sauce, and simmer for 1 minute. Serve immediately, passing more Parmesan cheese at the table.

Yield: 6 servings.

Note: You can also buy the pasta dough. Or buy fresh lasagna noodles and run them through a pasta machine as directed above.

Adapted from Suvir Saran

Time: About 30 minutes, plus 1 hour for draining yogurt and 2 hours (or overnight) for marinating shrimp

2 cups plain yogurt
1 tablespoon cumin seeds or 2 teaspoons ground cumin
3 tablespoons peeled and minced fresh ginger
3 tablespoons minced garlic
3 tablespoons toasted chickpea flour (besan) or all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 teaspoon garam masala or curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
12 colossal or very large shrimp (about 2 pounds), shelled
Salt
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 lemon, halved.

1. Over a bowl in a cheesecloth-lined strainer or a coffee filter, drain yogurt for at least 1 hour (if longer, refrigerate).

2. If you're using whole cumin, toast the seeds in a dry frying pan over medium heat, shaking, until fragrant and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Grind 2 teaspoons of the cumin seeds to a powder in a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle and set aside.

3. Stir together the ginger, garlic, flour, ground cumin, pepper, garam masala and turmeric in a bowl large enough to hold the shrimp. Stir in the lemon juice and then the drained yogurt, a bit at a time, stirring until smooth after each addition. Add the shrimp and toss to coat with the marinade. Refrigerate, covered, for at least 2 hours; overnight is fine.

4. Preheat the oven to 550 degrees, or as near that temperature as you can get it. (Or, if you are grilling, skip to step 5.) Put the shrimp in a single layer on a rack in a foil-lined baking pan, sprinkle with salt and roast 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest 15 minutes, then brush with the melted butter and roast another 10 minutes, until cooked through.

5. To grill prawns: When youre ready to cook, start a charcoal or gas grill; the fire should be very hot  you should barely be able to hold your hand over the core of it  and the rack about 4 inches from the heat source. Grill the shrimp for 3 minutes on each side; let rest 15 minutes off the grill, then brush with the butter and grill 5 to 10 more minutes, until cooked through.

6. Arrange the shrimp on a platter, sprinkle with the reserved toasted cumin seeds and squeeze the lemon over. Serve hot.

Add beef and thyme and stir, breaking up any clumps. Add water just to cover meat. Mix in salt, pepper and sugar and bring to a simmer. Taste for seasonings, adding salt, pepper and chili pepper, if necessary; mixture should be quite spicy. Simmer about 30 minutes, until meat is soft and water is reduced to a sauce. Set aside to cool slightly.

3. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Remove one disk of dough from refrigerator and divide it in half. Roll out one half on a lightly floured surface until large enough to cut three circles, each about 6 inches across. (Use the rim of a bowl turned upside down as a guide.) Repeat with remaining dough, setting aside the circles. Use scraps to make additional small patties, if you like.

4. When ready to fill, have ready a fork for crimping and a bowl of water. Place two tablespoons of filling on lower half of one circle. Dip a finger into water and moisten the edge of the dough. Fold the top half over, pulling dough gently over filling and making a thick edge all around. Crimp edge with a fork and transfer to an ungreased baking sheet, preferably nonstick. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Bake about 25 minutes, until top crust is firm and golden. Serve hot as is or inside buns.

Yield: 12 patties.

Time: About 1 hour

6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 cup sugar
2 large eggs, separated
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon lemon juice, more to taste
½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
¼ teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk, at room temperature
1 8-inch deep-dish pie crust, blind-baked until very lightly browned.

FOR THE ROAST:
13-rib portion of prime rib (6 to 8 pounds, preferably dry-aged), trimmed of excess fat (reserve it) and tied
½ cup ground cumin
1/3 cup ground cayenne
½ cup kosher salt
1/3 cup freshly ground black pepper

FOR THE STEAK SAUCE:
2 cups Worcestershire
½ cup ketchup
2 tablespoons Tabasco
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened2 teaspoons sesame oil

FOR THE POTATOES:
3 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and quartered
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 scant cup whole milk
3 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
¼ cup extra virgin olive oil.

1. Remove roast from refrigerator 2 hours before cooking. Heat oven to 375 degrees. In a small bowl, combine cumin, cayenne, salt and pepper. Set roast fat-side up on counter and rub a thick layer of spice mixture over entire surface. Transfer roast to a wire rack in a shallow roasting pan and place in oven for 13 to 15 minutes per pound.

2. While meat roasts, prepare steak sauce and potatoes. In a medium-size pot, combine Worcestershire, ketchup and Tabasco and set over medium heat. Reduce for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until mixture has thickened. Lower heat to warm and whisk in butter and oil. Transfer to gravy boat or bowl and allow to cool before for serving. (Stored in an airtight container, sauce will last in refrigerator for 2 weeks.)

3. While sauce reduces, place some trimmed fat in a small, heavy-bottomed pot over low heat until it melts. Place potatoes in a large pot, cover with cold water, add salt and place over high heat. When water boils, lower heat to medium and simmer until potatoes are soft, about 20 minutes. Shut off heat.

4. After roast has cooked for an hour, check temperature by inserting a meat thermometer deep into its thickest part, away from any bone. For medium rare, remove from oven at 125 degrees. Allow to rest 15 to 20 minutes before carving.

5. While roast rests, finish potatoes. Place a small pot over medium-low heat, add milk and garlic and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes. Shut off heat and discard garlic. Drain potatoes in a colander. Pass them through a potato ricer or sieve back into pot in which they were boiled. Add butter, milk, salt and pepper, place pot over low heat, and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon or whisk. Add olive oil, stirring, and a few tablespoons of rendered fat. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to warm.

6. Carve roast. Remove bones by slicing down their sides: reserve for later use or serve in a bowl with meal. Carve an inch-thick slice per person. Place on plate with whipped potatoes and sauce on the side.

3 hefty eggplants, peeled, sliced lengthwise about ¼-inch thick
3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon salt
4 or 5 large yellow onions, cubed or thinly sliced
1½ cups extra virgin olive oil (see note below)
½ cup slivered blanched almonds
½ cup pine nuts
1 large bunch fresh cilantro, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon garlic, very finely minced 1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon ground allspice
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
½ cup lemon juice plus 2 more lemons
2 or 3 large yellow potatoes, peeled, very thinly sliced
4 Arab squash (kousa) or zucchini, sliced lengthwise ¼-inch thick
2 fresh ripe tomatoes, thinly sliced
2 large red or yellow sweet peppers, coarsely chopped.

1. Combine eggplant with 3 tablespoons of salt in bowl and cover with cool water. Set plate on top and weight to keep eggplant submerged. Set aside for 30 to 60 minutes.

2. Set aside a half-cup of onion for topping. Combine remainder with a quarter-cup of oil in a heavy skillet and set over low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are pale caramel and very soft, almost melted into oil, 20 to 30 minutes (watch carefully to prevent burning). Transfer to a bowl, leaving as much oil in the skillet as possible.

3. Meanwhile, toast almonds in 1 tablespoon of oil in small skillet over medium-low heat until golden and crisp. Remove and add to onions. Add pine nuts to the skillet, with a little more oil if necessary, and toast until golden. Remove and add to onions.

4. In same skillet, add another tablespoon of oil and toss the cilantro with garlic until wilted. Add to onion and nut mixture, with a heaping tablespoon of the spice mixture (cumin, coriander, black pepper, allspice and nutmeg) and lemon juice. Stir to mix well. Taste, adding more spices or lemon juice, if desired.

5. Heat oven to 375 degrees.

6. Add another half-cup of oil to skillet in which onions were cooked and set over medium-low heat. When oil is hot, add potato slices. Cook on both sides until they are lightly golden and start to soften. Transfer to 9-x-12-inch oven dish. Line bottom of dish. Distribute a fourth of the onion mixture over the top; it will not cover the potatoes.

7. While potatoes are cooking, drain eggplant and dry with paper towels. Add more oil to skillet, if necessary, and cook eggplant slices on both sides until lightly golden. Use half the slices to cover the bottom layer, setting aside the other half. Distribute another quarter of onion mixture over eggplant.

8. In skillet cook squash or zucchini slices on both sides until lightly golden (add more oil if needed). Arrange over eggplant and distribute some of remaining onion mixture on top. Top with reserved eggplant slices and remaining onion mixture.

9. Arrange tomato slices on top, then sprinkle with peppers. Distribute reserved half onion over the top. Sprinkle with salt, and squeeze the juice of one lemon over it. Add about a half-cup boiling water, dribbling down around edges of pan. Transfer to oven and bake 20 to 30 minutes, or until top is starting to crisp and juices are bubbling.

10. Remove from oven and serve immediately; or set aside to cool to slightly above room temperature before serving.

Yield: 8 servings.

Note: Use olive oil and vegetable oil instead of all olive oil if you wish. Spice mixture will be more fragrant if you combine whole spices and grind to a powder in a spice grinder or a mortar.

3 cups chopped yellow onions (about 2 large onions)
1 35-ounce can plus 1 28-ounce can (about 7 cups) peeled tomatoes and liquid
1¼ cups fruity white wine.

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a bowl, combine garlic, rosemary, pepper, salt, brown sugar, red pepper and paprika. Place brisket fat-side up in a large, deep roasting pan (about 13 by 16 inches) and rub all over with mixture.

2. Roast brisket, uncovered, for 20 minutes. While brisket cooks, pour olive oil into a large saucepan over medium heat and add onions. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until onion softens, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and their liquid, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Stir occasionally, breaking tomatoes with a spoon or whisk. Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes and season to taste with salt and black pepper. Remove brisket from oven. Reduce oven temperature to 325.

3. Pour 1 cup wine and the tomato sauce over brisket. Cover pan as tightly as possible with foil and roast for 3½ hours, turning once at 2 hours and again at 3 hours, each time carefully replacing foil.

4. Transfer brisket to a platter. Allow sauce to settle for a moment in pan, then, using a slotted spoon, transfer to a blender, allowing fat to strain out. Purée until smooth, adding remaining ¼ cup wine. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Slice brisket diagonally from thinnest end in ¼-inch slices. Serve with sauce.

Yield: 8 to 10 servings.

Note: A whole brisket is composed of two flat pieces of meat (typically sold separately as \"first cut\" and \"second cut\") sandwiched together with a layer of fat between them and with a thick layer of fat along one side. A 12-pound untrimmed whole brisket weighs about 8 pounds when trimmed. If purchasing the brisket untrimmed, trim the external fat to within 1/3 inch or ½ inch of the flesh; also, excavate any large cavities of fat between the two layers.

2 cups peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped cucumber
1 tablespoon cucumber
vinegar (see note) or Champagne vinegar
Salt
3 pounds Persimmon or Golden Jubilee (large red or yellow) tomatoes, cored
and roughly chopped (about 6)
 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
2 slices country bread, crusts removed, cut into  -inch cubes
 cup finely chopped shallot
 cup finely chopped green pepper
2 tablespoons minced Serrano chili
1 cup grape, cherry or sweet 100.s tomatoes, blanched and peeled.

1. Chill 6 shallow soup bowls in the refrigerator. To make the cucumber
granita: Place the cucumber in a food processor and pulse until smooth.
Stir in the cucumber vinegar and salt, to taste, and place in a shallow,
wide pan in the freezer. Run a fork through the granita every 20 minutes
for approximately 2 hours. Keep in the freezer until ready to serve. (This
can be done the day before.)

2. Pass the tomatoes through a food mill using the finest attachment, then
strain the tomato juice through a fine-meshed sieve. Season with salt
(about 6 pinches) and chill in the refrigerator.

3. Place a medium saut pan over medium-high heat; add the olive oil. When
warm, fry the garlic until golden; use a slotted spoon to transfer to
paper towels. Season with salt and set aside. In the same oil, add the
cubed bread and fry until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon, then drain
on paper towels and season with salt.

4. Ladle the chilled soup into the chilled bowls. Float a large
tablespoonful of granita in the center of each bowl. Arrange the garnishes
(garlic, bread cubes, shallot, green pepper, chili and cherry tomatoes)
around the rims, or serve them separately and pass around at the table.

FOR THE DOUGH (SEE NOTE):
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
2 cups all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, more for oiling pans

FOR THE TOPPING:
1 pound ground beef (not more than 85 percent lean)
¼ cup tomato paste
½ onion, finely chopped
Juice of 1 lemon
1 teaspoon salt
1 ½ teaspoons allspice
1 tablespoon tamarind paste (available at Middle Eastern and Indian markets)
2 tablespoons pine nuts
Lemon wedges and coarse salt for sprinkling on top.

1. To make dough: Combine yeast and 2 tablespoons warm water and set aside for 5 minutes. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl; add oil, yeast mixture and a scant ½ cup warm water. Mix, using hands if necessary, until dough comes together: it should be elastic but not sticky. If needed, add a little more flour or water. Turn out onto a board (no need to flour it) and knead until soft and smooth, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place 1 hour.

2. When dough has risen, combine all ingredients for topping in a bowl. Divide dough in two and roll out on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut 3-inch rounds with a water glass or cookie cutter, stacking them between layers of wax paper. Roll and cut remaining dough.

3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spread a heaping tablespoon of meat mixture on each dough round, spreading all the way to the edge: meat mixture will shrink during baking. (Once assembled, pies can be frozen, stacked in wax paper, and then baked directly from freezer.) Arrange pies on 2 lightly oiled baking sheets. Bake 20 minutes, rotating pans halfway through baking. Serve hot, sprinkled with lemon juice and coarse salt.

Yield: About 2 dozen pies.

Time: About 1½ hours plus 14 to 20 hours rising

3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, more for dusting
¼ teaspoon instant yeast
1¼ teaspoons salt
Cornmeal or wheat bran as needed.

1. In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 5/8 cups water, and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.

2. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.

3. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.

4. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.

Yield: One 1½-pound loaf.

1¼cups all-purpose flour
¼ teaspoon salt
10 tablespoons unsalted butter, preferably a high-fat, European-style butter like Plugra, chilled and cut into ½-inch pieces
2 to 5 tablespoons ice water.

1. In a food processor, briefly pulse together the flour and salt. Add butter and pulse until mixture forms chickpea-size pieces (3 to 5 one-second pulses). Add ice water 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse until mixture is just moist enough to hold together.

2. Form dough into a ball, wrap with plastic and flatten into a disk. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before rolling out and baking.

Yield: One 9-inch single pie crust. Recipe can be doubled for a double crust; divide dough into two balls and form two disks before chilling.

Variations: You can experiment with textures and flavors by substituting 3 to 4 tablespoons shortening, lard, beef suet, duck fat or an unsweetened nut butter, such as hazelnut butter, almond butter or mixed nut butter, for 3 to 4 tablespoons regular butter. All should be well chilled before using.

Rendered leaf lard can be purchased from the Flying Pigs Farm stand at the Union Square and Grand Army Plaza Greenmarkets on Saturdays, or by mail order from Dietrichs Meats, (610) 756-6344, www.dietrichsmeats.com. Rendered duck fat is available online at www.dartagnan.com. Suet can be bought from butchers.

Cheddar Crust: This crispy crust pairs nicely with apple pie or savory pie fillings. Pulse together 1¼ cups flour with ¾ teaspoon salt. Add ¾ cup grated sharp cheddar; pulse until mixture forms coarse crumbs. Add 8 tablespoons chilled, cubed butter and proceed according to the directions for All-Butter Pie Crust.

Prebaked Crust: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. On a lightly floured surface, roll out pie crust to a 12-inch circle. Transfer crust to a 9-inch pie plate. Fold over any excess dough, then crimp edges. Prick crust all over with a fork. If you have time, freeze crust for 15 to 30 minutes; otherwise skip this step. Cover pie with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights (you can use pennies, rice or dried beans for this). Bake for 15 minutes; remove foil and weights and bake until pale golden, 5 to 7 minutes more. Cool on rack until needed.

    This is the contemporary version of the classic butter sauce, made without egg yolks.

    You can go anywhere from this basic beurre blanc, with endless variations -- herbs, fruit juices or purées, soy, chiles ... your imagination is the only limit.

    Make sure you use real shallots in this recipe, not green onions or scallions (which in New Orleans are often mistakenly called shallots). You can substitute onions if necessary, but they have a sharper flavor; use sweet onions if you have to substitute.

    This recipe doubles or triples well, also.

        * 2 tablespoons shallots, finely minced
        * 1/4 cup white wine or dry vermouth
        * 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice or white wine vinegar
        * 4 ounces unsalted butter, cut into pieces
        * Salt to taste
        * White pepper to taste 

    In a non-aluminum saucepan, combine shallots with the wine. Reduce a glace (until syrupy). Add the lemon juice or vinegar and reduce a glace. Remove from heat and add one chunk of butter, stirring with a whisk to blend. Slowly add all the pieces of butter until well combined. This technique is called monter au beurre, to finish, or \"mount\" a sauce with butter. If you need to return the sauce to the heat to incorporate all the butter, do it over very low heat, or the sauce will break.

    Strain the sauce through a fine mesh strainer and serve immediately, or hold in a double boiled over barely simmering water, or in a Thermos.

Time: 1 hour 45 minutes

3 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 medium onions, 2 finely chopped and 2 quartered
1 cup thinly sliced button or wild mushrooms
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 thick slices challah or other bread
1 large egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ teaspoon Hungarian sweet paprika, more as needed
1 3-to 4-pound chicken, quartered
½ pound trimmed green beans
4 carrots, peeled, trimmed and cut into large chunks.

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a skillet over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil and add chopped onions, mushrooms and garlic. Sauté until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.

2. Tear bread into large pieces and place in a bowl. Sprinkle with enough water to thoroughly dampen it on all sides. Allow to sit for 1 minute, then squeeze out as much water as possible. In a mixing bowl, combine bread, egg, parsley and onion-mushroom mixture. Season generously with salt, pepper and paprika to taste.

3. Divide stuffing into four equal portions. Gently pull enough skin from each chicken piece to be able to push stuffing mixture under skin. In a small bowl, combine remaining tablespoon oil with ½ teaspoon paprika and salt to taste. Mix well and brush over chicken pieces, saving a bit for basting.

4. In a 9-by-13-inch roasting pan, scatter quartered onions, green beans and carrots. Place chicken pieces skin-side up on vegetables. Roast uncovered for 60 minutes, basting halfway through. (If chicken begins to look too brown, cover lightly with foil.) Lower oven temperature to 275 degrees and continue to cook until meat is opaque and white all the way through, about 30 minutes more. To serve, place an equal amount of roasted vegetables on each of four plates, topped by a portion of chicken.

1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1 shoulder-end bone-in beef rib roast with 4 ribs (about 8 lbs.; ribs should be left long)

Sprinkle the pocket with about half the salt mixture, then insert rosemary and garlic, allowing rosemary sprigs to poke out of the roast. Tie the roast between the ribs with kitchen string. Sprinkle the remaining salt mixture on the outside of the roast. Place in a large roasting pan with ribs pointing up.

Don't use low-fat or fat-free milk in this recipe. Start the dumpling dough only when you're ready to top the stew with the dumplings.

Serve 6 to 8

Stew
5 	pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs 
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
4 	teaspoons vegetable oil 
4 	tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick)
4 	carrots , peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick
2 	ribs celery , sliced 1/4 inch thick
1 	large onion , minced
6 	tablespoon unbleached all-purpose flour 
1/4 	cup dry sherry 
4 1/2 	cups low-sodium chicken broth 
1/4 	cup whole milk 
1 	teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves  
2 	bay leaves 
1 	cup frozen green peas 
3 	tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves 

Dumplings
2 	cups unbleached all-purpose flour 
1 	tablespoon baking powder 
1 	teaspoon table salt 
1 	cup whole milk 
3 	tablespoons reserved chicken fat (or unsalted butter)


1. For the Stew: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels, then season with salt and pepper. Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add half of the chicken and cook until golden on both sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and remove the browned skin. Pour off the chicken fat and reserve. Return the pot to medium-high heat and repeat with the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and the remaining chicken. Pour off and reserve any chicken fat.

2. Add the butter to the Dutch oven and melt over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, celery, onion, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until softened, about 7 minutes. Stir in the flour. Whisk in the sherry, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in the broth, milk, thyme, and bay leaves. Nestle the chicken, with any accumulated juices, into the pot. Cover and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked and tender, about 1 hour.

3. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board. Discard the bay leaves. Allow the sauce to settle for a few minutes, then skim the fat from the surface using a wide spoon. Shred the chicken, discarding the bones, then return it to the stew.

4. For the Dumplings: Stir the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Microwave the milk and fat in a microwave-safe bowl on high until just warm (do not over-heat), about 1 minute. Stir the warmed milk mixture into the flour mixture with a wooden spoon until incorporated and smooth.

5. Return the stew to a simmer, stir in the peas and parsley, and season with salt and pepper. Following the photos below, drop golf-ball-sized dumplings over the top of the stew, about 1/4 inch apart (you should have about 18 dumplings). Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the dumplings have doubled in size, 15 to 18 minutes. Serve.

The longer sangria sits before drinking, the more smooth and mellow it will taste. A full day is best, but if thats impossible, give it an absolute minimum of two hours to sit. Use large, heavy, juicy oranges and lemons for the best flavor. Doubling or tripling the recipe is fine, but youll have to switch to a large punch bowl in place of the pitcher. An inexpensive Merlot is the best choice for this recipe.

Serves 4
2 	large juice oranges , washed; one orange sliced; remaining orange juiced
1 	large lemon , washed and sliced
1/4 	cup granulated sugar 
1/4 	cup Triple Sec 
1 	bottle inexpensive, fruity, medium-bodied red wine (750 milliliters), chilled


1. Add sliced orange, lemon, and sugar to large pitcher; mash gently with wooden spoon until fruit releases some juice, but is not totally crushed, and sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Stir in orange juice, Triple Sec, and wine; refrigerate for at least 2, and up to 8, hours.

INSERT INTO RECIPE (ID, TITLE, BODY, OWNER_ID, CATEGORY_ID, SUB_CATEGORY_ID, DATE_CREATED, VERSION) VALUES (seq_recipe.nextval, $$Paella$$, $$From America's Test Kitchen: Paella Party

This recipe is for making paella in a Dutch oven (the Dutch oven should be 11 to 12 inches in diameter with at least a 6-quart capacity). With minor modifications, it can also be made in a paella pan (see instructions below). Dry-cured Spanish chorizo is the sausage of choice for paella, but fresh chorizo or linguiça is an acceptable substitute. Soccarat, a layer of crusty browned rice that forms on the bottom of the pan, is a traditional part of paella. In our version, soccarat does not develop because most of the cooking is done in the oven. We have provided instructions to develop soccarat in step 5; if you prefer, skip this step and go directly from step 4 to 6.

Serves 6
1 	pound extra-large shrimp (21/25), peeled and deveined
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
	olive oil 
8-9 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 tablespoons)
1 	pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs , each thigh trimmed of excess fat and halved crosswise
1 	red bell pepper , seeded and cut pole to pole into 1/2-inch-wide strips
8 	ounces Spanish chorizo , sliced 1/2 inch thick on the bias (see note)
1 	medium onion , chopped fine (about 1 cup)
	1 can (14 1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes , drained, minced, and drained again
2 	cups Valencia rice or Arborio
3 	cups low-sodium chicken broth 
1/3 	cup dry white wine 
1/2 	teaspoon saffron threads , crumbled
1 	bay leaf 
1 	dozen mussels , scrubbed and debearded
1/2 	cup frozen green peas , thawed
2 	teaspoons chopped fresh parsley leaves  
1 	lemon , cut into wedges, for serving


1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Toss shrimp, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon oil, and 1 teaspoon garlic in medium bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper; set aside.

2. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, until skin begins to blister and turn spotty black, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer peppers to small plate and set aside.

3. Add 1 teaspoon oil to now-empty Dutch oven; heat oil until shimmering but not smoking. Add chicken pieces in single layer; cook, without moving pieces, until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn pieces and brown on second side, about 3 minutes longer; transfer chicken to medium bowl. Reduce heat to medium and add chorizo to pot; cook, stirring frequently, until deeply browned and fat begins to render, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer chorizo to bowl with chicken and set aside.

4. Add enough oil to fat in Dutch oven to equal 2 tablespoons; heat over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 3 minutes; stir in remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes; cook until mixture begins to darken and thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in rice and cook until grains are well coated with tomato mixture, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, wine, saffron, bay, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Return chicken and chorizo to pot, increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally. Cover pot and transfer to oven; cook until rice absorbs almost all liquid, about 15 minutes. Remove pot from oven (close oven door to retain heat). Uncover pot; scatter shrimp over rice, insert mussels hinged side down into rice (so they stand upright), arrange bell pepper strips in pinwheel pattern, and scatter peas over top. Cover and return to oven; cook until shrimp are opaque and mussels have opened, 10 to 12 minutes.

5. Optional: If soccarat (see note) is desired, set Dutch oven, uncovered, over medium-high heat about 5 minutes, rotating pot 180 degrees after about 2 minutes for even browning.

6. Let paella stand, covered, about 5 minutes. Discard any mussels that have not opened and bay leaf, if it can be easily removed. Sprinkle with parsley and serve, passing lemon wedges separately.

7. If You're Using a Paella Pan
A paella pan makes for an attractive and impressive presentation. Use one that is 14 to 15 inches in diameter. A 14-inch ovensafe skillet will work as well, but do not attempt to use anything smaller because the contents will simply not fit. Follow the recipe for Paella, increasing the chicken broth to 3 1/4 cups and the wine to 1/2 cup. Before placing the pan in the oven, cover it tightly with foil. For soccarat, cook the paella, uncovered, over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes, rotating the pan 180 degrees after about 1 1/2 minutes for even browning.

Bring the water, apple juice concentrate, salt, sugar, onion, peppercorns, mustard seeds, thyme and bay leaves to a simmer in a large stock pot and cook until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Let cool completely. Submerge the roast in the brine by placing a plate on top, then cover with plastic and refrigerate for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Remove the pork from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Season the pork all over with salt and pepper and cook on both sides until golden brown, about 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer the pork to a baking sheet and finish cooking in the oven until cooked to an internal temperature of 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest, loosely tented with foil, for 10 minutes.

While the pork is roasting, add the whiskey to the saute pan that the pork was cooked in, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, and cook until almost completely reduced. Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced to a sauce consistency. Whisk in the butter, season with salt and pepper, and stir in the parsley.

Cut pork into chops, top each chop with some of the Apple-Ginger Chutney, and drizzle a little of the sauce around the pork chop and over the chutney. Garnish with parsley sprig.

Adapted from The Revolutionary Chinese Cookbook, by Fuchsia Dunlop.

For the sauce:

1 tablespoon double-concentrate tomato paste, mixed with 1 tablespoon water
½ teaspoon potato flour
½ teaspoon dark soy sauce
1½ teaspoons light soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
3 tablespoons chicken stock or water

For the chicken:

12 ounces (about 4 to 5) skinless, boneless chicken thighs
½ teaspoon dark soy sauce
2 teaspoons light soy sauce
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons potato flour
1 quart peanut oil, more as needed
6 to 10 dried red chilies
2 teaspoons finely chopped ginger
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons sesame oil

Scallions, thinly sliced, for garnish.

1. Make the sauce by combining all the ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.

2. To prepare the chicken, unfold the chicken thighs and lay them on a cutting board. Remove as much of the sinew as possible. (If some parts are very thick, cut them in half horizontally.) Slice a few shallow crosshatches into the meat. Cut each thigh into roughly ¼ -inch slices and place in a large bowl. Add the soy sauces and egg yolk and mix well. Stir in the potato flour and 2 teaspoons peanut oil and set aside. Using scissors, snip the chilies into ¾ -inch pieces, discarding the seeds. Set aside.

3. Pour 3½ cups peanut oil into a large wok, or enough oil to rise 1½ inches from the bottom. Set over high heat until the oil reaches 350 to 400 degrees. Add half the chicken and fry until crisp and deep gold, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a plate. Repeat with the second batch. Pour the oil into a heatproof container and wipe the wok clean.

4. Place the wok over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons peanut oil. When hot, add the chilies and stir-fry for a few seconds, until they just start to change color. Add the ginger and garlic and stir-fry for a few seconds longer, until fragrant. Add the sauce, stirring as it thickens. Return the chicken to the wok and stir vigorously to coat. Remove from the heat, stir in the sesame oil and top with scallions. Serve with rice.

If you prefer not to brine, use a kosher chicken - it is salted and has a taste and texture similar to a brined bird. For extra crisp skin, after applying the flavored butter, let the chicken dry uncovered in the refrigerator 8 to 24 hours. Russet potatoes have the best potato flavor, but Yukon Golds have beautiful color and better retain their shape after cooking. Either works well in this recipe. A food processor makes quick and easy work of slicing the potatoes.

Serves 4
1 	cup kosher salt (or 1/2 cup table salt), for brine
1/2 	cup granulated sugar 
1 	whole chicken , 3 1/2 to 4 lbs
2 1/2 	pounds russet potatoes (4 to 5 medium), or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick
	Vegetable cooking spray (nonstick)
1 1/2 	tablespoons olive oil 
3/4 	teaspoon table salt (for potatoes)
	Ground black pepper

<a href=\"/recipes/index.cgi?action=display&id=281\">Mustard-Garlic Butter with Thyme</a>


1. Dissolve salt and sugar in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Immerse chicken and refrigerate until fully seasoned, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 500 degrees. Line bottom of broiler pan with foil and spray with nonstick vegetable cooking spray. Remove chicken from brine and rinse thoroughly under cold running water. Butterfly chicken, flatten breastbone, apply flavored butter (if using), and position chicken on broiler pan rack; thoroughly pat dry with paper towels.

2. Toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon oil, salt, and pepper to taste in medium bowl. Spread potatoes in even layer in foil-lined broiler pan bottom. Place broiler pan rack with chicken on top. Rub chicken with remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil and sprinkle with pepper.

3. Roast chicken until spotty brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate pan and continue to roast until skin has crisped and turned a deep brown and an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees in thickest part of breast, 20 to 25 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to cutting board. With potholders, remove broiler pan rack; soak up excess grease from potatoes with several sheets paper towels. Remove foil liner with potatoes from broiler pan bottom and invert foil and potatoes onto cookie sheet or second cutting board. Carefully peel back foil, using a metal spatula to help scrape potatoes off foil as needed. With additional paper towels, pat off remaining grease. Cut chicken into serving pieces and serve with potatoes.

Pulled pork can be made with a fresh ham or picnic roast, although our preference is for Boston butt. Preparing pulled pork requires little effort, but lots of time. Plan on 10 hours from start to finish: 3 hours with the spice rub, 1 hour to come to room temperature, 3 hours on the grill, 2 hours in the oven, and 1 hour to rest. Wood chunks help flavor the meat; hickory is the traditional choice with pork, although mesquite can be used if desired. Serve the pulled pork on plain white bread or warmed buns with the classic accompaniments of dill pickle chips and coleslaw. You will need a disposable aluminum roasting pan that measures about 10 inches by 8 inches as well as heavy-duty aluminum foil and a brown paper grocery bag.

Serves 8

Spicy Chili Rub
1 	tablespoon ground black pepper 
1 - 2 	teaspoons cayenne pepper 
2 	tablespoons chili powder 
2 	tablespoons ground cumin 
2 	tablespoons dark brown sugar 
1 	tablespoon dried oregano 
4 	tablespoons paprika 
2 	tablespoons table salt 
1 	tablespoon granulated sugar 
1 	tablespoon ground white pepper 

Pork
1 	bone-in pork roast , 6 to 8 pounds (preferably shoulder or Boston butt roast)

2 cups barbecue sauce )


1. Mix all spicy chili rub ingredients in small bowl, set aside.

2. If using a fresh ham or picnic roast, remove skin (see illustration below). Massage dry rub into meat. Wrap tightly in double layer of plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 3 hours. (For strong flavor, the roast can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)

3. At least 1 hour prior to cooking, remove roast from refrigerator, unwrap, and let it come to room temperature. Soak 4 (3-inch) wood chunks in cold water to cover for 1 hour and drain. Meanwhile, light a large chimney starter filled a bit less than halfway with charcoal briquettes (about 2 1/2 quarts, or about 40 briquettes), and burn until all the charcoal is covered with a layer of fine gray ash.

4. Empty the coals into the grill; build a modified two-level fire by spreading the coals onto one side of the grill, piling them up in a mound 2 or 3 briquettes high, leaving the other half with no coals. Open the bottom vents completely. Place the soaked wood chunks on the coals. Position the cooking grate over the coals, cover the grill, and heat until hot, about 5 minutes (you can hold your hand 5 inches above the coals for 2 seconds). Use a grill brush to scrape the cooking grate clean.

5. Set unwrapped roast in disposable pan (see illustration below) and place it on grate opposite the fire, (see illustrations below). Open grill lid vents three-quarters of the way and cover, turning lid so that vents are opposite chunks to draw smoke through the grill. Cook, adding about 8 briquettes every hour or so to maintain an average temperature of 275 degrees, for 3 hours.

6. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 325 degrees. Place roast in pan and wrap with heavy-duty foil to cover completely. Place pan in oven and cook until meat is fork-tender, about 2 hours.

7. Slide the foil-wrapped pan with the roast into a brown paper bag. Crimp top shut; rest roast 1 hour. Transfer roast to cutting board and unwrap. When cool enough to handle, \"pull\" pork by separating roast into muscle sections (see illustration, below), removing fat, if desired, and tearing meat into thin shreds with fingers. Place shredded meat in large bowl ; toss with 1 cup barbecue sauce, adding more to taste. Serve with remaining sauce passed separately.

Serve with a <a href=\"/recipes/index.cgi?action=display&id=283\">pan sauce</a>. We prefer natural to enhanced pork (pork that has been injected with a salt solution to increase moistness and flavor), though both will work in this recipe. Begin checking the doneness of smaller medallions 1 or 2 minutes early; they may need to be taken out of the pan a little sooner.

Serves 4 to 6
12-14 	slices bacon (1 slice for each pork medallion)
2 	pork tenderloins (1 to 1 1/4 pounds each), trimmed of fat and silver skin, cut crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces; thinner end pieces scored and folded (see steps 1 and 2 below)
	Kosher salt and ground black pepper 
2 	tablespoons vegetable oil 


1. Place bacon slices, slightly overlapping, in microwave-safe pie plate and cover with plastic wrap. Cook in microwave on high power until slices shrink and release about 1/2 cup fat but are neither browned nor crisp, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towels until cool, 2 to 3 minutes.

2. Wrap each piece of pork with 1 slice bacon and secure with 2 toothpicks where ends of bacon strip overlap, inserting toothpicks on angle and gently pushing them through to other side, (see illustration of Bacon 'Twine' below).

3. Season pork with pepper. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pork cut side down and cook, without moving pieces, until well-browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn pork and brown on second side, 3 to 5 minutes more. Reduce heat to medium. Using tongs, stand each piece on its side and cook, turning pieces as necessary, until sides are well browned and internal temperature registers 145 to 150 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 8 to 14 minutes. Transfer pork to platter and tent lightly with foil; let rest while making pan sauce, then serve.

Salt and pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage leaves
1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves

Brush steaks with mustard. Season the steaks on both sides with kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon per side. In a pie tin place peppercorns and press steaks in to coat each side with about 1 tablespoon. In a heavy-bottomed 12-inch saute pan heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil to smoking. Cook steaks for 3 minutes on each side. Transfer steaks to a plate.

Time: 3 hours, plus 1 day for marinating

6 large duck legs, including thighs
1 tablespoon coriander seeds, lightly toasted
1 1/2 teaspoons black peppercorns
1 teaspoon allspice berries
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried
2 teaspoons coarse salt
1 cup tawny port
1/2 cup dried cherries (not sweetened)
2 large shallots, thinly sliced
2 bay leaves
2 cups chicken stock
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Polenta or mashed potatoes, for serving.

1. One day before cooking, prepare duck legs: without cutting into skin, trim off excess fat (there may be quite a bit; reserve for roasting potatoes or vegetables). Place legs in a shallow bowl or sealable plastic bag. In a spice grinder or a mortar, combine coriander, peppercorns and allspice, and grind until coarse. Mix in thyme and coarse salt, and rub mixture all over duck legs. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

2. The next day, preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a small bowl pour port over cherries and set aside. Pat duck legs dry with paper towels; do not rub off spices. Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add 3 duck legs, skin side down. Cook until skin is browned and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes; turn and brown other side, about 4 minutes more. If skin begins to burn, adjust heat; bits at bottom of pan should be dark brown, not black. Transfer duck legs to a heavy 4- to 5-quart pot with a tight-fitting lid. Pour off all fat from skillet.

3. Repeat with remaining duck legs, but leave 2 teaspoons of fat in empty skillet. Return skillet to medium heat, add shallots and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add cherries and soaking liquid and simmer until reduced by half. Add bay leaves and stock and simmer until reduced by half. Pour over duck legs in pot. Cover tightly. Bake 1 hour, then turn and cook 1 hour more, or until tender.

4. If serving immediately, transfer duck legs to broiler pan and preheat broiler. Spoon off and discard as much fat as possible from braising liquid. Simmer liquid until thick and saucy, 8 to 10 minutes; add salt and pepper to taste. Broil duck legs until skin is crisp and sizzling, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve one whole leg on polenta or mashed potatoes, with sauce spooned over and around.

5. If holding for one or two days, refrigerate duck legs and braising liquid separately. Remove chilled fat from top of braising liquid and discard, then gently reheat duck legs in liquid. Transfer duck legs to broiler pan and preheat broiler. Finish dish as in Step 4.

Chef Vitaly Paley of Portland, Oregon is known for his eclectic style and interesting twists on comforting favorites. The two-chile combination with this brisket heats up a winter night. 

Prep and Cook Time: 3 to 3 1/2 hours. 

7 to 8 dried mild New Mexico chiles, stemmed and seeded
5 dried pasilla negro chiles, stemmed, seeded, and broken into pieces
1 star anise
1 teaspoon fennel seed
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
1 beef brisket (5 to 6 lbs.), trimmed of fat and membrane
1/2 cup sherry vinegar
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
1 can (14 oz.) whole peeled tomatoes
1 cup beef or chicken broth

1. Preheat oven to 350°. In a medium bowl, pour 3 cups boiling water over New Mexico chiles and let soak until softened, about 30 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup liquid.
2. Meanwhile, grind pasilla negro chiles, star anise, fennel seed, salt, and peppercorns in a spice mill or clean coffee grinder.

3. Rub brisket with spice blend; set aside.

4. Whirl soaked chiles, vinegar, and chile liquid in a blender until puréed. Set aside.

This recipe calls for a heavy ovenproof skillet. If you plan to serve the fish with a flavored butter or sauce, prepare it before cooking the fish. Even well-dried fish can cause the hot oil in the pan to splatter. You can minimize splattering by laying the halibut steaks in the pan gently and putting the edge closest to you in the pan first so the far edge falls away from you.

Serves 4 to 6
2 	tablespoons olive oil 
2 	halibut steaks , each about 1 1/4 inches thick and 10 to 12 inches long (about 2 1/2 pounds total), gently rinsed, dried well with paper towels, and trimmed of cartilage at both ends
	Table salt and ground black pepper 

<a href=\"/recipes/index.cgi?action=display&id=293\">Chipotle-Garlic Butter with Lime and Cilantro</a>

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. When oven reaches 425 degrees, heat oil in 12-inch, heavy-bottomed, ovenproof skillet over high heat until oil just begins to smoke, about 2 1/2 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, sprinkle both sides of both halibut steaks generously with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-high, swirl oil in pan to distribute; carefully lay steaks in pan and sear, without moving them, until spotty brown, about 4 minutes (if steak is thinner than 1 1/4 inches, check browning at 3 1/2 minutes; thicker steaks of 1 1/2 inches may require extra time, so check at 4 1/2 minutes). Off heat, flip steaks over in pan using two thin-bladed metal spatulas.

3. Transfer skillet to oven and roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into steaks reads 140 degrees, flakes loosen, and flesh is opaque when checked with tip of paring knife, about 9 minutes (thicker steaks may take up to 10 minutes). Remove skillet from oven and separate skin and bones from fish with spatula. Transfer fish to warm platter and serve immediately, with flavored butter or sauce, if desired.

3 tablespoons butter
1/3 medium red onion, diced
1 1/2 cups Arborio rice

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add half the asparagus stalks and cook until quite soft, at least 5 minutes. Rinse quickly under cold water. Put cooked asparagus in a blender or food processor and add just enough water to allow machine to puree until smooth; set aside.

2. Put stock in a medium saucepan over low heat. Put oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large, deep nonstick skillet over medium heat. When it is hot, add onion, stirring occasionally until it softens, 3 to 5 minutes.

3. Add rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is glossy, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add white wine, stir, and let liquid bubble away. Add a large pinch of salt. Add warmed stock, 1/2 cup or so at a time, stirring occasionally. Each time stock has just about evaporated, add more.

4. After about 15 minutes, add remaining asparagus pieces and tips, continuing to add stock when necessary. In 5 minutes, begin tasting rice. You want it to be tender but with a bit of crunch; it could take as long as 30 minutes total to reach this stage. When it does, stir in 1/2 cup asparagus puree. Remove skillet from heat, add remaining butter and stir briskly. Add Parmesan and stir briskly, then taste and adjust seasoning. Risotto should be slightly soupy. Serve immediately.

1 	tablespoon dry sherry 
1 	tablespoon oyster sauce 
1 	teaspoon sugar 
1 	teaspoon cornstarch

Chicken and Vegetables
1 	pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts , patted dry with paper towels, trimmed, and cut into 1-inch squares
1 	tablespoon soy sauce 
1 	tablespoon dry sherry 
2 	tablespoons toasted sesame oil 
1 	tablespoon cornstarch 
1 	tablespoon unbleached all-purpose flour 
1 	tablespoon minced fresh ginger 
1 	medium clove garlic , minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
8 	teaspoons peanut oil or vegetable oil
1 	small head bok choy , stalks sliced on the bias into 1/4-inch slices, and greens cut into 1/2-inch strips
1 	small red bell pepper , cut into 1/4-inch strips


1. For the noodle cake: Bring 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat in a large pot. Add the noodles and salt to the boiling water; cook the noodles until tender, 2 to 3 minutes (do not overcook). Drain thoroughly through a colander. Add the scallions to the noodles in the colander and toss to combine; set aside.

2. For the sauce: Meanwhile, whisk together the sauce ingredients; set aside.

3. For the chicken and vegetables: Toss the chicken with the soy sauce and sherry; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the sesame oil, cornstarch, and flour; set aside. In a small bowl, mix together the ginger, garlic, and 1 teaspoon peanut oil; set aside.

4. While the chicken marinates, cook the noodle cake. Heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Spread the noodles evenly across the bottom of the skillet and press with a spatula to flatten into a cake. Cook until crisp and golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes.

5. Slide the noodle cake onto a large plate. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil to the skillet; swirl to coat. Invert the noodle cake onto a second plate and slide it, browned side up, back into the skillet. Cook until golden brown on the second side, about 5 to 8 minutes.

6. Slide the noodle cake onto a cutting board and let sit for at least 5 minutes before slicing into wedges and serving. (The noodle cake can be transferred to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and kept warm in a 200-degree oven for up to 20 minutes).

7. Stir the marinated chicken into the sesame oil-cornstarch mixture until uniformly combined. Heat 2 teaspoons peanut oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until smoking; add half of the chicken to the skillet in a flat, even layer. Cook, without stirring, but gently separating the pieces, until golden brown on the first side, about 1 minute; turn the chicken pieces and cook until lightly browned on the second side, about 30 seconds. Transfer the chicken to a clean bowl. Repeat with an additional 2 teaspoons peanut oil and the remaining chicken; cover to keep warm.

8. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon peanut oil to the now-empty skillet and return to high heat until just smoking. Add the bok choy stalks and red bell pepper and cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.

9. Push the vegetables to the sides of the skillet to clear the center; add the garlic-ginger mixture to the clearing and cook, mashing the mixture with a spoon, until fragrant, 15 to 20 seconds, then stir the mixture into the stalks and continue to cook until the stalks are tender-crisp, about 30 seconds longer. Stir in the bok choy greens and cook until beginning to wilt, about 30 seconds.

10. Return the chicken to the skillet. Whisk the sauce to recombine, then add to the skillet and cook, tossing constantly, until the sauce is thickened and the chicken is heated through, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.

For easier turning on the grill and added rosemary flavor, use two rosemary sprigs as each skewer.

12 large sea scallops
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
8 (12-inch) fresh rosemary sprigs
Hot cooked basmati rice
Garnish: lemon slices

Combine scallops and next 4 ingredients in a medium bowl; cover and chill 30 minutes.

Pick leaves off 6 inches of one end of each rosemary sprig, leaving the other end intact. Soak rosemary sprigs in water in a shallow dish 20 minutes.

Place 2 rosemary skewers side by side, leaving a small space between. Thread 3 scallops onto bare part of rosemary skewers. Repeat with remaining rosemary and scallops. Grill over medium-high heat 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Serve on a bed of basmati rice with lemon slices, if desired.

Note: For smoky flavor, cut slices of prosciutto in half lengthwise and wrap 1 piece around each scallop before skewering.

Wine note: \"Soave Classico by Masi ($9) from Italy would do well here. The rosemary highlights floral notes in the wine, while (if using the prosciutto recipe variation) the prosciutto's saltiness and mild gamey flavors are softened. Often served with seafood, Soave is not overbearing, but food-friendly.\"--Franklin Ferguson, wine director and bar manager, Citrine restaurant, Los Angeles, CA.

5 large cloves garlic, finely chopped

½ to ¾ cup of your favorite olive oil

12 basil leaves

7 large ripe tomatoes

Salt

1 pound dried rigatoni

1 pound fresh, lightly salted mozzarella

Country bread.

1. Take out your largest bowl. Add the garlic. Pour in ½ cup olive oil. With scissors, snip the basil leaves into shreds over the garlic mixture. Let sit all day.

2. About 2 hours before serving, chop the tomatoes and add them to the bowl.

3. When youre ready to eat, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Meanwhile, cut the mozzarella into small cubes.

4. Drain the pasta and pour it on top of the tomato mixture. Do not stir. Spread the mozzarella on top of the pasta and toss only the pasta and cheese; the cheese will soften slightly, and the pasta will get coated with fat. Then stir up from the bottom, incorporating the tomato mixture. Season with salt and add the remaining olive oil, if desired. Serve with bread. Serves 6.

2007: Paccheri With Caprese Lobster Salad

By Fortunato Nicotra, executive chef at Felidia in Manhattan.

Paccheri, a large, tubular dried pasta, is available in New York at

Buon Italia and Agata & Valentina.

For the salad:

Sea salt

1 -1 ½ -pound lobster

3 ½ ounces buffalo mozzarella

bocconcini, cut into ½ -inch wedges

1 ½ cups assorted cherry tomatoes, halved (or, if in season, small heirloom tomatoes, cut into wedges)

8 large basil leaves, torn

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

For the pasta:

¾ pound paccheri

½ cup extra-virgin olive oil

2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced

1 tablespoon chopped parsley.

1. Prepare the salad: bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the lobster and cook for 11 minutes. Remove the lobster and reserve the cooking water. When the lobster is cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the shell and cut it into ½ -inch pieces.

2. In a medium bowl, fold together the mozzarella, tomatoes, lobster, basil and olive oil. Season to taste with sea salt.

3. Return the lobster water to a boil. Stir in the pasta and cook for 7 minutes (it should still be firm).

4. Meanwhile, set a 10-inch sauté pan over medium heat and pour in the olive oil. When it starts to shimmer, add the garlic and sauté until golden around the edges. Add a ladleful (about 1/2 cup) of the pasta water to the sauté pan.

5. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the paccheri to the sauté pan. Cook over medium-high heat for about 2 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente. Stir in the parsley.

6. Divide the pasta among 4 plates (or 6 if serving as an appetizer). Top each with the lobster salad. Serves 4 as a main course, 6 as an appetizer.$$,1,@cat6,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2007-07-31', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Using the right amount of charcoal is crucial here; using too much charcoal will burn the chicken, while using too little will extend the cooking time substantially. The temperature inside the grill should be about 375 degrees at the outset and will fall to about 300 by the time the chicken is done. For added accuracy, place a grill thermometer in the lid vents as the chicken cooks. If you prefer, use lemonade instead of beer; fill an empty 12-ounce soda or beer can with 10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) of lemonade and proceed as directed.

Serves 4

Spice Rub
1/2 	cup sweet paprika 
2 	tablespoons kosher salt 
2 	tablespoons garlic powder 
1 	tablespoon dried thyme 
2 	teaspoons ground celery seed 
2 	teaspoons ground black pepper 
2 	teaspoons cayenne pepper 

Chicken
2 	cups wood chips , or 2 (3-inch) wood chunks
1 	whole chicken (about 3 1/2 pounds)
1 	can beer (12-ounce), see note
2 	bay leaves 
	Large disposable aluminum baking pan (13 by 9-inch)


1.For Spice Rub: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Measure 3 tablespoons for use in this recipe. Extra rub can be stored (or frozen) in an airtight container for several weeks.

2. For Chicken: Soak the wood chunks or chips in cold water to cover for 1 hour and drain. If using wood chips, divide them between two 18-inch squares of aluminum foil, seal to make two packets, and use a fork to create about six holes in each packet to allow smoke to escape.

3. Massage the spice rub all over the chicken, inside and out. Lift up the skin over the breast and rub the spice rub directly onto the meat. Open the beer can and drink about 1/4 cup. With a church key can opener, punch two more large holes in the top of the can (for a total of three holes). Crumble the bay leaves into the beer. Slide the chicken over the can so that the drumsticks reach down to the bottom of the can and the chicken stands upright; set aside at room temperature.

4. Light a large chimney starter filled two-thirds with charcoal (4 quarts, or about 60 briquettes) and allow to burn until the coals are fully ignited and partially covered with a thin layer of ash, 15 to 20 minutes.

5. Place the disposable pan in the center of the grill. Pour half of the coals into a pile on each side of the grill, leaving the pan in the center. Nestle 1 soaked wood chunk (or 1 foil packet) on top of each coal pile. Position the cooking grate over the coals, cover the grill, and heat until hot, about 5 minutes; scrape the grate clean with a grill brush.

6. Place the chicken (with the can) in the center of the cooking grate with the wings facing the coals (the ends of the drumsticks will touch the grate and help steady the bird). Cover and grill-roast, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 170 to 175 degrees, 65 to 85 minutes.

7. With a large wad of paper towels in each hand, transfer the chicken to a platter or tray, making sure to keep the can upright; let rest for 15 minutes. Using wads of paper towels, carefully lift the chicken off the can and onto a platter or cutting board. Discard the remaining beer and can. Carve the chicken and serve.

Grill-Roasting Two Chickens: There are some occasions when you may want to cook more than one chickenwhen you have more guests to serve or if youd like to have leftovers on hand. Heres how:

Increase the number of wood chunks to 4 (or 4 cups of wood chips), use 6 tablespoons Spice Rub, two 3 1/2 pound chickens and increase the amount of charcoal to a three-quarters full chimney (4 1/2 quarts, or about 70 briquettes). In step 6, set the chickens (and cans) in the middle of the cooking grate, with the chickens breasts facing one another, about 3 inches apart (keeping the chickens close together ensures that they wont hit the top of the domed grill lid). Grill-roast as directed.

1. Bring 4 quarts water to rolling boil in large pot. Toast pine nuts in small dry skillet over medium heat, shaking pan occasionally, until just golden and fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes.

2. When water is boiling, add garlic and let cook 1 minute. Remove garlic with slotted spoon and rinse under cold water to stop cooking; set aside to cool. Add 1 tablespoon salt and pasta to water, stir to separate, and cook until tender (just past al dente). Reserve 1/4 cup cooking water, drain pasta, toss with 1 tablespoon oil, spread in single layer on rimmed baking sheet, and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

3. When garlic is cool, peel and mince or press through garlic press. Place 1/4 cup nuts, garlic, basil, spinach, pepper, lemon juice, remaining 1/4 cup oil, and 1 teaspoon salt in bowl of food processor and process until smooth, scraping sides of bowl as necessary. Add cheese and mayonnaise and process until thoroughly combined. Transfer mixture to large serving bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to assemble salad.

4. When pasta is cool, toss with pesto, adding reserved pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until pesto evenly coats pasta. Fold in remaining 1/2 cup nuts and tomatoes (if using); serve.

Prep and Cook Time: 3 hours. 

Layers of ragù and creamy, nutmeg-scented béchamel are a subtle departure from the familiar cheese-laden lasagna favored by many Americans; our version is actually closer to authentic Italian lasagna. However, we streamlined the ragù by using sweet Italian sausage instead of the traditional beef, pork, and/or veal blend. 

Notes: Imported, commercially produced dried lasagna noodles (the kind you boil first) work well in this recipe, but if you can find fresh noodles at a specialty shop, try those instead. Just boil the noodles a few at a time for 2 minutes, plunge in an ice bath, and dry before assembling.


About 7 tbsp. butter
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup onion, cut into 1/4-in. dice
1/2 cup carrots, cut into 1/4-in. dice
1/2 cup celery, cut into 1/4-in. dice
1 pound bulk sweet Italian sausage (or 1 lb. sausage links removed from their casings)
About 1 1/2 tsp. salt
4 cups whole milk
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 can (28 oz.) whole tomatoes, including juices, finely chopped or crushed with your hands
Freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
12 ounces lasagna noodles (see Notes)
1 cup good-quality grated Parmesan

1. In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt 2 tbsp. butter in oil over medium heat. Add onion and cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Add carrots and celery and cook 5 more minutes. Add sausage and 1/2 tsp. salt, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, and cook until meat loses its raw color.

2. Add 1 cup milk and cook over medium heat, stirring, until completely absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes. (The milk will appear quite curdled at this point; don't be alarmed.) Add wine and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, bring to a boil, lower heat, and gently simmer, uncovered, 2 hours. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

3. After the ragù has cooked for 1 1/2 hours, make the béchamel by melting remaining 5 tbsp. butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until it turns light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Slowly drizzle in remaining 3 cups milk, whisking constantly. Bring to a simmer and continue to cook, whisking, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with remaining 1 tsp. salt, nutmeg, and pepper to taste.

4. Preheat oven to 375°. Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions, being careful not to overcook. Drain and lay flat on dish towels, making sure the noodles do not overlap. Butter the bottom of a 9- by 13-in. baking dish and coat with about 1/2 cup of ragù. Add a single layer of noodles (for most brands this is 4 sheets per layer). Spread on 1/3 of the béchamel; top béchamel with 1/4 of the remaining ragù, then 1/4 of the parmesan. Repeat layering two more times, covering final layer with remaining ragù and parmesan.

5. Cover lasagna with buttered aluminum foil and bake 20 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional 10 minutes, or until the top browns slightly. Let sit 15 minutes before serving.

Be sure to buy shrimp with their shells on and reserve the shells when cleaning the shrimp; they add important flavor to the cooking liquid in step 2. We like Sauvignon Blanc or any non-oaky Chardonnay in this recipe. Any small clams, such as littlenecks work well, but avoid large clams which will not only take up more room in the pot, but will exude more liquid than desired, diluting the broth. The cooking time of the scallops will depend on their size; we used extra- large scallops (about 2 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick), but if your scallops are smaller (about 1 inch in diameter and 1/2 inch thick), they will cook more quickly and should be added to the pot with the shrimp.

Serves 4

Picada

2 	slices high-quality white sandwich bread , torn into quarters
2 	tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
1/8 	teaspoon salt

1/4 	cup olive oil 
16 	extra-large shrimp  (21 to 25 per pound), peeled, deveined, and shells reserved
1 1/2 	cups dry white wine  (see note)
1 	medium onion , minced
1 	medium red bell pepper , stemmed, seeded, and chopped fine
3 	medium garlic cloves , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
1 	teaspoon sweet paprika 
1/4 	teaspoon saffron threads , crumbled
1/8 	teaspoon red pepper flakes

16 	mussels  (about 8 ounces), scrubbed and debearded if necessary
8 	large sea scallops  (about 8 ounces), tendons removed
1 	tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves 
	Ground black pepper 
1 	teaspoon juice  from 1 lemon, plus extra to taste


1.For the picada: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 375 degrees. Pulse the nuts in a food processor to fine crumbs, about 15 pulses. Add the bread, olive oil, salt, and pepper and continue to pulse the bread to coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses. Spread the mixture out evenly over a rimmed baking sheet and toast, stirring often, until golden brown, about 10 minutes; set aside to cool.

2. For the stew: Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the reserved shrimp shells and cook until pink, about 5 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the wine, cover, and let steep until ready to use.

3. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion, bell pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until the onion is softened and lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic, paprika, saffron, pepper flakes, and bay leaves and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the brandy and simmer for 30 seconds. Stir in the tomatoes with their juice and cook until slightly thickened, 5 to 7 minutes.

4. Strain the wine mixture into the Dutch oven through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing on the shrimp shells to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the shells. Continue to simmer until the flavors have melded, 3 to 5 minutes. (At this point, the broth can be cooled and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 day. Bring the broth to a simmer in a covered large Dutch oven over medium heat before continuing.)

5. Increase the heat to medium high, add the clams, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the first few clams begin to open, about 5 minutes. Add the mussels and scallops, cover, and continue to cook until most of the clams have opened, about 3 minutes longer. Add the shrimp, cover, and continue to cook until the shrimp are pink and cooked through and the clams and mussels have opened, about 2 minutes longer.

6. Discard the bay leaves and any mussels or clams that have not opened. Stir in the picada and parsley and season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste. Serve immediately.

Almost any variety of brined or oil-cured olive works in this recipe, although we preferred a mix of both green and black olives. Instant yeast is commonly labeled rapid-rise yeast. Use a spray bottle filled with water to mist the loaves. The bread will keep for up to 2 days, well wrapped and stored at room temperature. To recrisp the crust, place the bread in a 450-degree oven for 5 to 10 minutes. The bread will keep frozen for several months when wrapped in foil and placed in a large zipper-lock bag.

Makes Two 12 by 3-Inch Loaves
1 3/4 	cups water (14 ounces), room temperature
2 	teaspoons instant yeast

2 	teaspoons table salt 
2 	tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary 
1 1/2 	cups pitted olives (6 ounces), rinsed, chopped rough, and patted dry (see note above)


1. Whisk water, yeast, and honey in bowl of standing mixer. Add flours and mix on low speed with dough hook until cohesive dough is formed, about 3 minutes. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.

2. Remove plastic wrap; make well in center of dough and add salt and rosemary. Knead dough on low speed (speed 2 on KitchenAid) for 5 minutes (if dough creeps up attachment, stop mixer and scrape down). Increase speed to medium and continue to knead until dough is smooth and slightly tacky, about 1 minute. If dough is very sticky, add 1 to 2 tablespoons flour and continue mixing for 1 minute. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and pat into 12 by 6-inch rectangle. Press olives evenly into dough. Starting at long side, roll rectangle into tight lo. With seam side facing up, roll log into coil. Transfer dough, spiral side up, to oiled container or bowl, at least 2 quarts in volume, and cover with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm, draft-free location until it increases in size by 50 percent, about 1 hour.

3. Fold partially risen dough over itself. Turn bowl 90 degrees; fold again. Turn bowl again; fold once more. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise 30 minutes. Repeat folding, replace plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.

4. Transfer dough to lightly floured work surface, being careful not to deflate. Divide dough in half, loosely shape each piece into ball, and let rest 15 minutes. Flip each ball over and, starting from top, roll into tight oval shape. Using palms, roll each oval (seam side down) from center outward until 12-inch loaf is formed. Poke any olives that fall off into bottom seam, then pinch seam closed. Transfer each loaf, seam side down, to 12 by 6-inch piece of parchment and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours (dough is ready when it springs back slowly when pressed lightly with finger). Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, place baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 450 degrees at least 30 minutes before baking.

5. Slide parchment sheets with loaves onto peel or back of inverted baking sheet. Starting and stopping about 1 inch from each side, use razor blade or sharp knife to cut 3 1/2-inch-deep slashes on diagonal along top of each fully risen loaf; spray loaves lightly with water. Carefully slide parchment with loaves into oven using jerking motion. Bake 15 minutes, spraying loaves with water twice more in first 5 minutes, and then reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees. Continue to bake until bread is deep golden brown and instant-read thermometer inserted into center of loaf registers 210 degrees, 25 to 30 minutes.

Look for a top sirloin roast that has a thick, substantial fat cap still attached. The rendered fat will help to keep the roast moist. When making the jus, taste the reduced broth before adding any of the accumulated meat juices from the roast. The meat juices are well seasoned and may make the jus too salty. A heavy-duty roasting pan with a dark or nonstick finish or a broiler pan is a must for this recipe.

Serves 6 to 8

Beef
8 	large cloves garlic , unpeeled
1 	top sirloin roast (4-pound), with some fat intact

Garlic-Salt Rub
3 	large cloves garlic , minced
1 	teaspoon dried thyme

2 	sprigs fresh thyme  
2 	bay leaves 
1/2 	teaspoon table salt 
1/2 	cup olive oil 
	Ground black pepper 

Jus
1 1/2 	cups low-sodium beef broth 
1 1/2 	cups low-sodium chicken broth 


1. For the beef: Toast unpeeled garlic cloves in small skillet over medium-high heat, tossing frequently, until spotty brown, about 8 minutes. Set garlic aside. When cool enough to handle, peel cloves and cut into 1/4-inch slivers.

2. Using paring knife, make 1-inch-deep slits all over roast. Insert toasted garlic into slits.

3. For the garlic-salt rub: Mix minced garlic, thyme, and salt together in small bowl. Rub all over roast. Place roast on large plate and refrigerate, uncovered, at least 4 hours or preferably overnight.

4. For the garlic paste: Heat halved garlic cloves, thyme, bay leaves, salt, and oil in small saucepan over medium-high heat until bubbles start to rise to surface. Reduce heat to low and cook until garlic is soft, about 30 minutes. Cool completely. Strain, reserving oil. Discard herbs and transfer garlic to small bowl. Mash garlic with 1 tablespoon garlic oil until paste forms. Cover and refrigerate paste until ready to use. Cover and reserve garlic oil.

5. Adjust oven rack to middle position, place nonstick roasting pan or broiler pan bottom on rack, and heat oven to 450 degrees. Using paper towels, wipe garlic-salt rub off beef. Rub beef with 2 tablespoons reserved garlic oil and season with pepper. Transfer meat, fat side down, to preheated pan and roast, turning as needed until browned on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes.

6. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees. Remove roasting pan from oven. Turn roast fat side up and, using spatula, coat top with garlic paste. Return meat to oven and roast until internal temperature reaches 125 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 50 to 70 minutes. Transfer roast to cutting board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes.

7. For the jus: Drain excess fat from roasting pan and place pan over high heat. Add broths and bring to boil, using wooden spoon to scrape browned bits from bottom of pan. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 2 cups, about 5 minutes. Add accumulated juices from roast and cook 1 minute. Pour through fine-mesh strainer.

Time: 45 minutes

Vegetable oil for frying

8 ounces corn tortillas (preferably a mixture of red, white and blue), cut into 1-inch strips
1 8- to 9-inch stick Mexican cinnamon, broken into pieces 2 teaspoons dried Mexican oregano
5 whole cloves
8 cups chicken stock
1 pound chicken breast, cut into 3/4 inch dice
4 to 6 tablespoons fresh lime juice, as needed, plus 4 to 6 slices of lime, for garnish
Salt
8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese
2 avocados, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice
1/2 cup finely sliced cilantro leaves.

1. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat, and add about 1/2 inch oil. Set aside a baking sheet lined with paper towels. When oil shimmers, add a strip of tortilla; oil is hot enough when tortilla becomes crisp and very lightly browned in about 30 seconds. Adjust heat as necessary and add strips in batches, transferring to paper towels as they cook.

2. Heat oven or toaster-oven to 400 degrees. Place cinnamon pieces, oregano and cloves on a baking sheet or metal tray, and roast until lightly browned and fragrant, about 5 minutes; be careful not to burn.

3. Place chicken stock in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add roasted spices, lower heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour stock through a fine-meshed strainer into a clean pan, and return to a simmer. Add diced chicken and simmer until chicken is opaque in center, about 10 minutes. Add 4 to 6 tablespoons lime juice, as desired, and season with salt to taste.

4. To serve, place equal portions of chicken in center of each soup plate. Top with a small mound of fried tortilla strips and 1 to 2 tablespoons shredded cheese. Pour chicken broth into bowl, keeping mound intact. Garnish each bowl with avocado, a slice of lime and cilantro.

For pot roast, we recommend a chuck-eye roast. Most markets sell this roast with twine tied around the center. If necessary, do this yourself. Seven-bone and top-blade roasts are also good choices for this recipe. Remember to add only enough water to come halfway up the sides of these thinner roasts, and begin checking for doneness after 2 hours. If using a top-blade roast, tie it before cooking to keep it from falling apart. Mashed or boiled potatoes are good accompaniments to pot roast.

Serves 6 to 8
1 	chuck-eye roast (about 3 1/2 pounds), boneless
	Table salt and ground black pepper 
2 	tablespoon vegetable oil 
1 	medium onion , chopped medium
1 	small carrot , chopped medium
1 	small rib celery , chopped medium
2 	medium cloves garlic , minced
2 	teaspoons granulated sugar 
1 	cup low-sodium chicken broth 
1 	cup low-sodium beef broth 
1 	sprig fresh thyme  
1 1/2 	cups water 
1/4 	cup dry red wine 


1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Thoroughly pat roast dry with paper towels; sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.

2. Heat oil in large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Brown roast thoroughly on all sides, reducing heat if fat begins to smoke, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer roast to large plate; set aside. Reduce heat to medium; add onion, carrot, and celery to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and sugar; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add chicken and beef broths and thyme, scraping bottom of pan with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Return roast and any accumulated juices to pot; add enough water to come halfway up sides of roast. Bring liquid to simmer over medium heat, then place large piece of foil over pot and cover tightly with lid; transfer pot to oven. Cook, turning roast every 30 minutes, until fully tender and meat fork or sharp knife easily slips in and out of meat, 3 1/2 to 4 hours.

3. Transfer roast to carving board; tent with foil to keep warm. Allow liquid in pot to settle about 5 minutes, then use wide spoon to skim fat off surface; discard thyme sprig. Boil over high heat until reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, about 8 minutes. Add red wine and reduce again to 1 1/2 cups, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

4. Using chefs or carving knife, cut meat against the grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices, or pull apart into large pieces; transfer meat to warmed serving platter and pour about 1/2 cup sauce over meat. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

Presalting the turkey adds flavor and helps it stay moist during roasting; so does covering the breast and drumsticks with bacon. Prep and Cook Time: at least 3 hours, plus brining time.

1 free-range organic turkey (12 to 14 lbs.)
3 tablespoons salt
1 teaspoon juniper berries
1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
1/2 cup butter
1/3 cup minced fresh thyme leaves
1/4 cup minced fresh sage leaves
2-in. rosemary sprig, leaves removed and minced
8 slices thick-cut bacon
1 cup dry white wine

1. Rinse turkey and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle all over with salt, working some under the skin on breast and thighs. Put in a roasting pan, cover with foil or plastic wrap, and chill for at least 24 hours and up to 3 days.

2. Preheat oven to 400°. Unwrap turkey, discard any juices that have collected in pan, and pat turkey dry. Set aside. In a spice mill or clean coffee grinder, finely grind juniper berries, mustard seeds, and peppercorns. Rub spices all over turkey and set aside. In a small bowl, mix butter, thyme, sage, and rosemary until well combined. Massage mixture all over turkey and place bird in a large stovetop-safe roasting pan. Lay bacon slices over breast and drumsticks. Pour wine and 1/2 cup water into bottom of pan.

3. Roast turkey 1 hour, turning pan 180° halfway through. Reduce heat to 350° and roast, turning pan every 30 minutes, until a thermometer inserted straight down through the thickest part of breast to bone registers 155°, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

4. Transfer turkey to a carving board, loosely cover with foil, and let rest 30 minutes to 1 hour. Pour pan drippings into a glass measuring cup for gravy, reserving pan to make gravy. Carve turkey and serve with gravy.

1/2 cup sugar, plus 1 tablespoon for sprinkling
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
1/2 teaspoon table salt 
1 teaspoon finely grated zest from 1 lemon 

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Score and remove half of wrapper from each stick of frozen butter. Grate unwrapped ends on large holes of box grater (you should grate total of 8 tablespoons). Place grated butter in freezer until needed. Melt 2 tablespoons of remaining ungrated butter and set aside. Save remaining 6 tablespoons butter for another use. Place blue¬berries in freezer until needed. 

2. Whisk together milk and sour cream in medium bowl; refrigerate until needed. Whisk flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and lemon zest in medium bowl. Add frozen butter to flour mixture and toss with fingers until thoroughly coated. 

3. Add milk mixture to flour mixture; fold with spatula until just combined. With rubber spatula, transfer dough to liberally floured work surface. Dust surface of dough with flour; with floured hands, knead dough 6 to 8 times, until it just holds together in ragged ball, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking.

4. Roll dough into approximate 12-inch square. Fold dough into thirds like a business letter, using bench scraper or metal spatula to release dough if it sticks to countertop. Lift short ends of dough and fold into thirds again to form approximate 4-inch square. Transfer dough to plate lightly dusted with flour and chill in freezer 5 minutes.
 
5. Transfer dough to floured work surface and roll into approximate 12-mch square again. Sprinkle blueberries evenly over surface of dough, then press down so they are slightly embedded in dough. Using bench scraper or thin metal spatula, loosen dough from work surface. Roll dough, pressing to form tight log. Lay seam-side down and press log into 12 by 4-inch rectangle. Using sharp, floured knife, cut rectangle cross¬wise into 4 equal rectangles. Cut each rectangle diagonally to form 2 triangles and transfer to parchment-lined baking sheet. 

6. Brush tops with melted butter and sprinkle witl1 remaining tablespoon sugar. Bake until tops and bottoms are golden brown, 18 to 25 minutes. Transfer to wire rack and let cool 10 minutes before serving.

Grate the zest from the limes before juicing them, avoiding the bitter white pith that lies just beneath the outermost skin. The optional coconut garnish adds textural interest and tames the lime flavor for those who find it too intense. The recipe can be doubled and baked in a 13- by 9-inch baking pan; you will need a double layer of extra-wide foil for the pan (each sheet about 20 inches in length) and should increase the baking times by a minute or two.

Add brown sugar and salt; process to combine, ten to twelve 1-second pulses (if large sugar lumps remain, break them apart with fingers). Drizzle butter over crumbs and pulse until crumbs are evenly moistened with butter, about ten 1-second pulses. Press crumbs evenly and firmly into bottom of prepared pan. Bake until deep golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack while making filling. Do not turn off oven.

3. TO MAKE THE FILLING: While crust cools, in medium bowl, stir cream cheese, zest, and salt with rubber spatula until softened, creamy, and thoroughly combined. Add sweetened condensed milk and whisk vigorously until incorporated and no lumps of cream cheese remain; whisk in egg yolk. Add lime juice and whisk gently until incorporated (mixture will thicken slightly).

4. TO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE: Pour filling into crust; spread to corners and smooth surface with rubber spatula. Bake until set and edges begin to pull away slightly from sides, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack to room temperature, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Cover with foil and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours.

5. Loosen edges with paring knife and lift bars from baking pan using foil extensions; cut bars into 16 squares. Sprinkle with toasted coconut, if using, and serve. (Leftovers can be refrigerated up to 2 days; crust will soften slightly. Let bars stand at room temperature about 15 minutes before serving.)$$,1,@cat3,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2008-04-06', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

You will need between five and six tablespoons of lemon juice for this recipe. Because the amount of juice can vary from lemon to lemon, we suggest you first measure the juice from the three lemons you have zested, then juice a fourth lemon if necessary. Serve this cake as is or dress it up with lightly sweetened berries. The cake has a light, fluffy texture when eaten the day it is baked, but if well wrapped and held at room temperature overnight its texture becomes more dense -- like that of pound cake -- the following day.

Serves 12 to 14

Cake
3 	lemons , zest grated and saved, then juiced for 3 tablespoons juice (see note above)
3 	cups unbleached all-purpose flour (15 ounces)
1 	teaspoon baking powder 
1/2 	teaspoon baking soda 
1 	teaspoon table salt 
1 	teaspoon vanilla extract 
3/4 	cup low-fat buttermilk (preferably)
3 	large eggs , at room temperature
1 	large egg yolk , at room temperature
18 	tablespoons unsalted butter (2 1/4 sticks), at room temperature
2 	cups sugar (14 ounces)

Glaze
23 	tablespoons fresh lemon juice (see note above)
1 	tablespoon buttermilk 
2 	cups confectioners' sugar (8 ounces)


1. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 12-cup Bundt pan with nonstick baking spray with flour (alternatively, brush pan with mixture of 1 tablespoon flour and 1 tablespoon melted butter). Mince lemon zest to fine paste (you should have about 2 tablespoons). Combine zest and lemon juice in small bowl; set aside to soften, 10 to 15 minutes.

2. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl. Combine lemon juice mixture, vanilla, and buttermilk in medium bowl. In small bowl, gently whisk eggs and yolk to combine. In standing mixer fitted with flat beater, cream butter and sugar at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes; scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula. Reduce to medium speed and add half of eggs, mixing until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Repeat with remaining eggs; scrape down bowl again. Reduce to low speed; add about one-third of flour mixture, followed by half of buttermilk mixture, mixing until just incorporated after each addition (about 5 seconds). Repeat using half of remaining flour mixture and all of remaining buttermilk mixture. Scrape bowl and add remaining flour mixture; mix at medium-low speed until batter is thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Remove bowl from mixer and fold batter once or twice with rubber spatula to incorporate any remaining flour. Scrape into prepared pan.

3. Bake until top is golden brown and wooden skewer or toothpick inserted into center comes out with no crumbs attached, 45 to 50 minutes.

4. FOR THE GLAZE: While cake is baking, whisk 2 tablespoons lemon juice, buttermilk, and confectioners' sugar until smooth, adding more lemon juice gradually as needed until glaze is thick but still pourable (mixture should leave faint trail across bottom of mixing bowl when drizzled from whisk). Cool cake in pan on wire rack set over baking sheet for 10 minutes, then invert cake directly onto rack. Pour half of glaze over warm cake and let cool for 1 hour; pour remaining glaze evenly over top of cake and continue to cool to room temperature, at least 2 hours.

3 tablespoons butter, extra virgin olive oil, or a combination
Salt and freshly ground black pepper.

1. Heat oven to 500 degrees; while it heats, put bread in, and check frequently until it is lightly toasted and dry. Coarsely grind or grate bread and cheese together (a small food processor is best), and keep crumbs larger than commercial bread crumbs.

2. Rinse asparagus, and break off woody bottoms. Lay stalks in a baking dish that will hold them in two or three layers. Toss with bits of butter or the oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and place in oven.

3. Roast 5 minutes, then shake dish to redistribute butter or oil. Roast 5 minutes more, then test for doneness by piercing a spear with point of a sharp knife; it should slide in but meet a little resistance. (Up to this point, the recipe can be made as much as two hours before serving; just leave asparagus at room temperature).

4. Turn on broiler and place rack as close as possible to heating element. Top asparagus with cheese-crumb mixture and run under broiler to brown, a minute or two. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Variations

This recipe is easily varied. For instance, forget the topping and toss the spears with 1 tablespoon of minced garlic when you add the oil, then roast. Skip the broiler step.

For roast asparagus with soy and sesame, use 1 tablespoon peanut oil instead of olive oil or butter. Halfway through roasting, add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce to the asparagus, toss gently and finish roasting.

3 CURRIED EGG SALAD Make egg salad with hard-cooked eggs, mayo, curry powder, Dijon mustard, fresh lime juice, salt, pepper, cilantro, red onion and, if you like, diced apple.

4 TOMATOES AND PEACHES Toss together sliced seeded tomatoes and peaches, along with thinly sliced red onion and chopped cilantro or rosemary. Dress at the last minute with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper.

5 ROAST BEEF AND BLUE Start with whole-grain rolls. Smear blue cheese on one side and prepared horseradish on the other. Add red onion and thin-sliced roast beef, pork or lamb. Pack! lettuce and tomato on the side. Potato chips are mandatory.

6 CORNFLAKE CHICKEN BITES Cut boneless chicken breasts into small pieces. Dip in milk or buttermilk, then dredge in seasoned crushed corn flake crumbs, cornmeal or panko. Pan-fry in oil, drain, cool and eat cold with celery sticks, with ranch or blue cheese dressing for dipping.

7 GRAPES AND CHEESE Mix feta cubes and green grapes (or grape tomatoes or pieces of watermelon). Add mint, salt, pepper and olive oil. A tiny bit of chopped fresh chili is good, too.

8 COLD PEANUT NOODLES Cook Chinese egg noodles or regular spaghetti. Drain and rinse. Toss with sesame oil, peanut butter (or tahini), sugar, soy sauce, ginger, vinegar, black pepper (lots) and chili oil (optional). Pack shredded seeded cucumber, cooked shrimp and chopped scallions separately.

While its cooling, whisk together tahini, lemon juice, salt, pepper, garlic and parsley in a bowl. Chop the eggplant flesh (leave the peel behind) and roughly mash in the bowl. Add red pepper flakes if you like. Serve with pita.

23 Simmer one part olive oil, two parts red wine vinegar and four parts water with herbs, salt and pepper. Add chopped vegetables, firmest to softest  maybe carrots first, then cauliflower, then peppers  and poach until just getting tender. Remove from heat and chill overnight in the liquid.

24 Cut zucchini into big chunks and roast or grill with olive oil (and, if you like, whole garlic cloves). Combine with chopped seeded tomatoes, lemon juice, dill, salt and pepper.

25 Toss cauliflower florets with oil, salt and pepper, and roast in a hot oven until browned and cooked; while still warm, toss with curry powder and a handful of raisins. Pour on the lemon juice.

26 Soak wakame or other seaweed in hot water until soft; drain and squeeze dry. Toss with chopped celery, sesame oil, soy sauce, mirin (or honey) and rice wine vinegar. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds.

27 Clean a bunch of mixed mushrooms; quarter any large ones. Steam for about five minutes. When still warm, toss with sliced shallots, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper, cracked coriander seeds, chopped fresh cilantro, sherry vinegar and more olive oil if necessary.

28 In a blender or food processor, combine ginger, a half cup or so light miso, a little more than that of walnuts, and enough soy sauce to make a sauce. Toss with cooked green beans or eggplant.

29 Steam or boil a bunch of asparagus; slice on the bias. Toss with orange segments, zest and juice, some olive oil, salt and pepper. Garnish with sesame seeds. Add little shrimp or shredded crab, lobster or chicken if you like.

30 Steam or boil green beans or asparagus; slice on the bias. Toss with thinly sliced red onion, matchstick-size pieces of prosciutto (or lardo if youre in Colonnata), olive oil, lemon juice, a pinch of red pepper flakes, salt and pepper.

BEAN, RICE AND GRAIN SALADS

31 Combine cooked or canned (and drained) black beans, kidney beans and chickpeas. Add diced red and green pepper, some corn kernels and a minced jalapeño. Season with lime juice, chopped marjoram or oregano, salt and pepper.

32 Cook lentils with garlic, onion and thyme. Toss with salt, pepper and fresh chopped herbs: marjoram, tarragon, chervil or basil. Dress with vinaigrette made with oil, vinegar and mustard.

33 Toss cooked or canned white beans with chopped seeded tomato, chopped anchovy, chopped olives, oil, lemon juice, lots of black pepper, salt if necessary and parsley.

34 Steam frozen (shelled) edamame or limas. Toss with chopped seeded tomatoes, cilantro, soy sauce and a suspicion of sesame oil. Salt and pepper.

35 Steam frozen edamame and chill. Toss with olive oil, lemon juice, a pinch of sugar, lots of chopped mint, salt, pepper, and as much shaved pecorino or Parmesan as you like.

36 Mix cooked rice and cooked lentils with very, very well caramelized onions. Add sherry vinegar, salt, pepper and, if necessary, a bit of oil.

37 Combine cooked brown rice with small, barely cooked broccoli florets and chopped pecans or walnuts and parsley. Dress with salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon.

38 Combine cooked Arborio rice with thin pesto, peas, toasted pine nuts, salt and pepper.

39 Soak a tablespoon or two of black beans in sherry or wine; toss with cooked rice, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil and cilantro.

40 Mix cooked couscous with olive oil; add pimentón, cumin, salt and pepper, chopped shallot or red onion, toasted slivered almonds and orange zest and juice. Cooked cauliflower is good, too.

41 Toss a load of chopped parsley with a little cooked bulgur  say three to one in favor of the parsley. Chopped seeded tomatoes, olive oil, salt, pepper and lots of lemon juice. Call this real tabbouleh.

42 Make tabbouleh as above and embellish with more vegetables  like cucumbers and radishes  and/or crumbled feta, or bits of cooked chicken. Or smoked tofu, or bacon, whatever you can think of. How can you go wrong? 

POTATO SALADS AND EGG SALADS

43 Make potato salad with mustard vinaigrette. Add chopped cooked asparagus, peas, green beans, etc. Or steamed mussels.

44 Make potato salad with mayo and crumbled bacon, and add grated Cheddar, celery, onion and chopped egg. You dont have to pack much else except blood thinner.

45 Roast or boil sweet potatoes, but not too soft. Make a blended vinaigrette with a little chili, cumin, sherry vinegar and olive oil. Pack separately and toss together with scallions and mint.

46 Make egg salad with sesame oil and seeds, soy sauce, rice vinegar, scallions and chilies.

47 Egg salad with chopped seeded tomato, basil and extra virgin olive oil.

48 Egg salad with sour cream, smoked salmon and chopped chives.

ALSO

49 Take cold pizza and lemon. Squeeze lemon over pizza. Really.

50 Mix a couple of cups of cold leftover cooked short-grain rice (if you happen to have risotto lying around, so much the better) with three eggs. Form balls; insert a small cube of mozzarella into each. Roll in bread crumbs and refrigerate if convenient. Deep or shallow fry until golden. Packed carefully, these will be fine. Call them supplì al telefono.

51 Purée roasted red peppers (jarred are O.K., piquillo are even better) with feta, marjoram or oregano and parsley, olive oil and garlic. Serve as a dip.

52 Make burritos, using the biggest flour tortillas you can find: rice, beans, any stewed or grilled meat or chicken, cilantro, salsa.

53 Marinate firm goat or feta cheese in olive oil, with rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, red and black pepper. You dont need much of this, but its good.

54 Make a cheese ball: Mash together equal parts good grated Cheddar, crumbled blue and cream cheese, maybe thinned with a little sour cream. Shape into a ball and roll in fresh chopped herbs and/or hazelnuts. Take Triscuits. You think people wont eat this? 

FRUIT

55 Make simple syrup with rosemary; purée in a blender with watermelon, rum (optional) and lemon juice. Use more rum and call this a cocktail, or omit rum, add a little feta and eat with a spoon. Keep it cold in either case.

56 Use a spoon or melon baller to make equal size pieces of watermelon, honeydew, cantaloupe, or, I dont know, Charentais. Mix together and sprinkle with lemon juice and salt or (better still) chili, sugar, salt and lime.

57 (A) Make fruit salad, however you like it; pack it. (B) Take seeded papaya halves, well wrapped. Put (A) in (B), drizzle with lemon, and serve.

58 Husk and quarter strawberries; at the last minute, combine with a little chopped tarragon, black pepper and balsamic vinegar. Goat cheese is good, too.

59 Cut melon into wedges and wrap thin slices of prosciutto around them. Stack in a container, drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper. Take romaine lettuce and serve the wedges over the greens, with the accumulated juices as a dressing. It works.

60 Toss cornbread cubes with blueberries, lemon juice, olive oil and hazelnuts. Yes. 

SEAFOOD

61 Toss chopped shrimp or shredded crab or lobster with lemon juice, chopped chives, salt and pepper. Use this to fill avocado halves. (If the avocado browns, blame me. Itll still taste great.)

62 Boil potatoes, corn kernels and shrimp; drain and chill. Serve with crusty bread and lemon wedges along with mayo mixed with garlic and crumbled saffron. Call this Aegean seafood salad.

63 Drain a can of good quality salmon (preferably sockeye). Mix with cannellini beans, chopped tomato, diced shallot, chopped black or green olives, chopped parsley and basil. Dress with olive oil and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Serve on bread (scooped out ciabatta is very nice) or over greens.

64 Combine a bunch of watercress or arugula with thinly sliced radishes and red onion; add flaked smoked trout or whitefish. Dress at the last minute with olive oil, sherry vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt and pepper.

65 Cut salmon fillets (the skin can be on or off) into serving-size pieces, and sear them in oil on both sides until brown; set aside. Sauté onions, garlic, fresh chilies if you like; deglaze the pan with one part red wine vinegar, two parts each red wine and water. Pour over fish and chill for up to two days. This will work with mackerel, chicken, pork, etc. Call this escabeche.

66 Make escabeche with white wine and vinegar, dill and lemon slices.

67 Pan-cook shrimp in oil. Separately sauté fresh and dried chilies with lots of onions and garlic; add beer, reduce and pour glaze over shrimp.

68 Mix good canned tuna with diced fennel, tarragon, lemon juice, salt and pepper. No mayo.

69 Mix good tuna with mashed anchovies (packed in olive oil), grated Parmesan, bits of lemon and some lemon juice, olive oil and perhaps a thimbleful of Worcestershire. No mayo.

70 You want an idea for tuna with mayo, I know: Mix tuna with mayo and mustard; add capers and dill.

MEAT AND POULTRY

71 Cut chicken wings into two parts, toss with olive oil, salt and pepper, and grill or roast until crisp and golden. Whisk together mustard, honey and lemon juice, and toss with warm wings. Chill overnight (or eat them and take something else to the picnic).

72 Combine equal parts soy sauce, mirin and sake with a little sugar and sesame oil; boil for a minute. Use this to baste chicken thighs, pork or beef while you grill or broil it. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and/or chopped scallions  ginger and/or lemon are good too  just before serving. Call it teriyaki. Works with mackerel and other dark fish, too.

73 Make chicken teriyaki as above, then toss with a little mayo and perhaps more soy. Awesome.

74 Poach chicken and chop or shred. Toss with lemon juice, olive oil and herbs of your choice.

75 Pack in three containers: grilled sliced beef or pork, with its juices; watercress or arugula tossed with mint, basil and/or cilantro; a dressing of lime juice, sesame oil, fish or soy sauce and sugar. Dress greens; put meat and its juices over all.

76 Thinly slice grilled butterflied leg of lamb; toss with cherry tomatoes, olive oil, mint, feta and chopped red onion.

77 Grind chunks of lamb shoulder in a food processor with onion, parsley, salt and pepper. Make into small meatballs and sauté or roast. Serve sliced with pita wedges or in pita, with lemon, and a dollop of yogurt or tapenade.

78 Split small chickens or Cornish hens; grill or broil quickly, with lots of salt and pepper. Take them whole to the picnic with sandwich rolls, good barbecue sauce (O.K., and mayo) and pickles. Pick off the meat and go to it.

79 Cut quail in half, or not; marinate with salt, pepper, minced garlic, sage and oil for as long as you can  at least five minutes. Grill for 10 to 15 minutes.

80 Chop various salamis, mortadella, etc. and combine with chopped provolone, Parmesan, bell pepper, red onion and fresh oregano. Heavily dress in vinaigrette. Take shredded romaine lettuce for tossing. And bread, obviously. 

SANDWICHES

81 Make chopped olive salad (I like onion, thyme, capers, a little garlic). Hollow out a medium-size round bread, or a few rolls. Put in olive salad and cured meats of your choice: ham, prosciutto, salami, mortadella, whatever; and provolone. Call this a muffuletta.

82 Slice open a good baguette and fill it with chopped or shredded cooked chicken tossed with fish sauce, chili, sugar, lime, garlic, scallions and Thai basil (or, in a dire emergency, regular).

83 Fry chopped bacon until half done; add strips of boneless chicken and cook until done; pack. Take pitas, chopped seeded tomato, avocado, sliced red onion and shredded romaine. Assemble sandwiches in situ; dress with olive oil and cheap vinegar.

84 Blanch frozen fava beans in salted water. Pulse in a food processor with some mint or parsley until roughly chopped; season with salt, pepper and fresh lemon juice. Slice baguette and spread one half with fresh ricotta, then drizzle with olive oil. Spread the other half with the fava beans. Put arugula in there and sandwich-ize.

85 Butter both halves of a sliced baguette. Layer with thinly sliced cured ham  Serrano, prosciutto, Bayonne, York, whatever  and many halved cornichons. Call this une sandwich.

86 Halve a cucumber or two; scoop out the seeds. Slice it thin and salt it for a bit if you have time; in any case squeeze out some of the liquid. Combine it with shredded cooked chicken, ginger, soy sauce, salt, pepper and cilantro. On a baguette, its reminiscent of banh mi.

87 Grill a steak; slice it thin. Butter a baguette on one side; put Dijon on the other side. Pile the bread with steak, roasted peppers (canned are fine; piquillos are best), and something crunchy, like radicchio or fennel. A little blue cheese wouldnt hurt either. Neither would avocado. (But not both.)

88 Cook peeled shrimp; little ones are best. Toss with pesto: lots. Put on small rolls. (In fact: cook anything; toss with pesto: lots. Put on small rolls.)

89 Dredge fish fillets in cornmeal. Sauté in abundant olive oil until crisp. Let cool a bit, then use for sandwiches, packing tomatoes separately.

90 Hard-cook some eggs; slice them. Sauté some spinach with oil and garlic until quite dry; chop. Make mustardy sandwiches with baguettes, rolls or any bread that can absorb some oil.

COLD NOODLES

91 Cook fusilli or other cut pasta; rinse in cool water, but dont bother to chill. Combine with chopped seeded tomatoes, cubed fresh mozzarella, chopped basil, olive oil, salt and pepper. (Good with olives, too.) Do not call this pasta salad, because pasta salad is no good, and this is.

92 Shred carrots and zucchini. Mix lime juice, soy sauce, grated ginger and sesame oil. Cook soba noodles, drain and rinse under cold water. Toss noodles with the vegetables and dressing.

93 Cook rice vermicelli and drain. Toss with kimchi, lots of cilantro and cooked chopped shrimp or chicken.

94 Cook garlic in olive oil until just sizzling; add clams (you can use canned clams but it will not be the same), and, cook, stirring, until they open. Remove, chop and combine with the garlic, oil, any liquid in pan, chopped tomato and cooked pasta. Add more oil as needed, with lemon juice, parsley, salt (if needed), pepper and oregano, if you like. 

DESSERTS

95 Combine equal parts honey and brown sugar with a little oil and bring to a boil; toss with good granola until the mixture is very sticky. You can add more nuts, or raisins and, yes, O.K., you can add chocolate chips. Line a pan with waxed paper or film with oil. Press mixture into pan and let cool. Call these granola bars.

96 Cook a couple of pounds of berries with some sugar and a little water until they break down. Layer in a plastic container with slices of good pound cake. Pour any remaining juices on top. You might want some cream.

97 Make sandwiches of angel food cake and ganache or fruit compote.

98 Mix peanut butter and cream cheese. Spread between two good cookies and make sandwiches. Or mix honey, lemon zest and cream cheese. Make sandwiches with ginger snaps.

99 Put sorbet (make it yourself if you have time) in a really cold thermos; it will be slushy by the time you open it. Add a splash of Champagne or Gewürztraminer if you like, maybe some mint, and eat like cold soup.

100 Take a container of melted chocolate thinned with cream or crème fraîche with strawberries, pineapple or bananas for dipping.

101 Take the makings of Smores. Build a fire.

This dish is best when prepared with whole-milk yogurt, but low-fat yogurt can be substituted. For a spicier dish, do not remove the ribs and seeds from the chile. If you prefer, substitute 2 teaspoons ground coriander, 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper for the garam masala. The sauce can be made ahead, refrigerated for up to 4 days in an airtight container, and gently reheated before adding the hot chicken. Serve with basmati rice.


Chicken Tikka
1/2  	teaspoon  ground cumin 
1/2  	teaspoon  ground coriander 
1/4  	teaspoon  cayenne pepper 
1  	teaspoon  table salt 
2  	pounds  boneless, skinless chicken breasts , trimmed of fat
1  	cup  plain whole-milk yogurt (see note above)
2  	tablespoons  vegetable oil 
2  	medium garlic cloves , minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
1  	tablespoon  grated fresh ginger 

Masala Sauce
3  	tablespoons  vegetable oil 
1  	medium onion , diced fine (about 1 1/4 cups)
2  	medium garlic cloves , minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
2  	teaspoons  grated fresh ginger 
1  	fresh serrano chile , ribs and seeds removed, flesh minced (see note above)
1  	tablespoon  tomato paste 
1  	tablespoon  garam masala (see note above)
1  	(28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 
2  	teaspoons  sugar 
1/2  	teaspoon  table salt 
2/3  	cup  heavy cream 
1/4  	cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves

1. FOR THE CHICKEN: Combine cumin, coriander, cayenne, and salt in small bowl. Sprinkle both sides of chicken with spice mixture, pressing gently so mixture adheres. Place chicken on plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes. In large bowl, whisk together yogurt, oil, garlic, and ginger; set aside.

2. FOR THE SAUCE: Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until light golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, chile, tomato paste, and garam masala; cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, sugar, and salt; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in cream and return to simmer. Remove pan from heat and cover to keep warm.

3. While sauce simmers, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position (about 6 inches from heating element) and heat broiler. Using tongs, dip chicken into yogurt mixture (chicken should be coated with thick layer of yogurt) and arrange on wire rack set in foil-lined rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan. Discard excess yogurt mixture. Broil chicken until thickest parts register 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer and exterior is lightly charred in spots, 10 to 18 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through cooking.

4. Let chicken rest 5 minutes, then cut into 1-inch chunks and stir into warm sauce (do not simmer chicken in sauce). Stir in cilantro, adjust seasoning with salt, and serve.

1 tablespoon cumin
1 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 ½ teaspoons cayenne

For the ribs:

2 (2-to-3-pound) racks baby-back ribs
Vegetable oil
2 tablespoons apple-wood dust or chips (see note)
1 cup apple cider or juice
1 teaspoon kosher salt

For the barbecue sauce:

1 cup ketchup
2 1/3 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1 ½ cup apple cider or juice
1 ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
1 ½ cup packed dark brown sugar
1 ¼ cup Worcestershire or soy sauce
2 teaspoons mustard
3 ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
1 ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
1 ¼ teaspoon cayenne
1 1/3 cup cooked bacon, minced
1 1/3 cup finely grated peeled apple
1 1/3 cup finely grated onion.

1. Make the rub by combining all ingredients in a small bowl. Several hours or 30 minutes before cooking, cut the ribs in half, brush with oil and sprinkle about 6 tablespoons of the Magic Dust on all sides.

2. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Place a stove-top smoker or homemade smoker (see note) on a burner. Place the wood chips on the bottom of the smoker, toward the center. Cover with the drip pan. Set the grate over the drip pan and place the ribs on the rack, cutting them as needed to fit in one layer. Cover with a lid or foil, making sure there is at least 1 inch between the lid and the ribs. Set the heat to high. When smoke appears, lower the heat to medium-high and smoke for 35 minutes.

3. Make the barbecue sauce: combine all the ingredients except the apple and onion in a medium pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the apple and onion, reduce the heat and simmer uncovered, stirring often, until slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. The sauce will keep for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.

4. Line a large-rimmed baking sheet with heavy foil. Add the cider, 1 cup of water and the salt. Set a rack over the pan. Transfer the ribs to the rack. Cook in the oven until the meat shrinks away from the ends and comes easily off the bone, about 1½ hours. Brush the ribs on all sides with the sauce and cook for 15 minutes more.

By MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN

This is a main dish gratin that makes a nice vegetarian meal when its served with either a salad or green vegetable. The cumin contributes a Mediterranean flavor to the dish.

1 garlic clove, cut in half

1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

1 pound leeks, white and light green parts only, cut in half lengthwise, sliced and rinsed of sand

Salt and freshly ground pepper

1 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly toasted and crushed in a mortar and pestle or a spice mill

2 pounds russet potatoes or Yukon golds, peeled if using russets, scrubbed if using Yukon golds, and sliced 1/4 inch thick

3 ounces Gruyère cheese, grated (3/4 cup, tightly packed)

2 1/3 cups low-fat milk

1. Preheat the oven to 375ºF. Rub the inside of a 2-quart gratin or baking dish with the cut side of the garlic clove. Brush lightly with olive oil.

2. Heat the remaining olive oil in a wide, heavy nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the leeks. Cook, stirring often, until tender, for about 5 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and freshly ground pepper to taste and stir in the crushed cumin seeds. Stir together for half a minute and remove from the heat.

3. Place the potatoes in a large bowl and season generously with salt and pepper. Add the leeks mixture and half the cheese, and toss together. Arrange in the baking dish in an even layer. Pour in the milk. Place the baking dish on a baking sheet and place in the oven.

4. Bake the gratin for 45 minutes, checking after 30 minutes and pressing the potatoes down into the milk with the back of a spoon. At 45 minutes, remove the dish from the oven and again press the potatoes down into the liquid. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top and bake for another 30 to 45 minutes, or until nicely browned. Remove from the heat and allow to sit for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.

Yield: Serves 6 to 8

Time: 1 1/2 hours plus optional overnight marinating

1 flank steak, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds
Salt and pepper
1 tablespoon fresh marjoram or oregano, or 1 teaspoon dried
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic
1/2 bunch each chopped fresh parsley and cilantro leaves, or all of one or the other
6 or 8 thin carrot sticks (1 medium carrot)
1 cup pitted green olives
1 medium red onion, sliced
1 bunch watercress, trimmed
2 tablespoons olive oil.

1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Use a boning knife to butterfly flank steak: Working across the grain, make a cut down the center, but only halfway through meat. At the top of that cut, make perpendicular cuts, one in each direction, this time with the grain. Again, cut only halfway into steak. Repeat perpendicular cuts at the other end of the center cut. Cuts should resemble a capital letter I.

2. At the top of the original center cut, hold the knife parallel to the meat and insert knife. Slice toward you, making a pocket. This cut should almost reach the outer edge, halfway through the meats thickness. Repeat on other side. Open the flaps.

3. Season meat liberally on both sides with salt and pepper, then place it cut side up, wide side facing you. Season with marjoram, cumin and garlic and cover it with a fairly even layer of parsley-cilantro mix. Then arrange carrots, olives and onions horizontally over the full width of the meat. Scatter a relatively even layer of watercress over all.

4. Roll meat up from the bottom like a jellyroll; grain of steak should run length of roll. Tie in three or four places with butchers twine.

5. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven or roasting pan large enough to accommodate rolled steak. Deeply brown it on all sides, about 15 minutes total, then transfer pan to oven and roast for about 30 minutes, until meat is cooked through. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 30 minutes before serving. Or, put meat in a clean baking dish, weight it with a plate with something heavy on it and chill overnight. Take matambre from refrigerator and slice it into 1/2-inch to 1-inch pieces about an hour before serving at room temperature.

Makes about 2 quarts

There are dozens of mulling spice blends on the market, but many taste dusty and muddy. We wanted the perfect blend of spices and a method for infusing the cider that wouldn't take hours. The key is choosing the right spiceswe like cinnamon, coriander, black peppercorns, and cloves. Be sure to use whole spices and toast them briefly in a skillet to intensify their flavors. Use a meat mallet or heavy saucepan to break the cinnamon stick into several pieces.

    * 1 cinnamon stick, broken into pieces
    * 1/2 teaspoon whole coriander seeds
    * 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
    * 1/4 teaspoon whole cloves
    * 2 quarts apple cider
    * 4 strips orange zest (each about 2 inches long)
    * 1-3 tablespoons light brown sugar or dark brown sugar (to taste)

   1. Toast spices in large saucepan over medium heat, shaking pan occasionally, until fragrant, 1 to 3 minutes. Add cider, orange zest, and sugar and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, using wide, shallow spoon to skim away foam that rises to surface. Pour cider through fine-mesh strainer lined with coffee filter and discard spices and orange zest. Serve. (Mulled cider can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 1 week.

1/4 cup chopped salami such as soppressata
2 tablespoons chopped scallions
3/4 cup heavy cream.

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Using a pastry cutter, cut cold butter into dry ingredients. Add soppressata and scallions and combine gently. Add cream and mix, preferably with your hands, until a shaggy dough forms.

2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 3 to 5 turns, just until dough comes together. Gently pat dough into a 1-inch-thick rectangle. Using a 2-inch biscuit cutter, cut out 6 to 8 biscuits. Press scraps together and cut out another 2 to 4 biscuits.

3. Transfer biscuits to a baking sheet and brush generously with softened butter. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until biscuits are lightly browned.

FOR THE ROLLS:

1 1 1/4-ounce package dry active yeast
3 tablespoons plus 1 pinch sugar
1 cup milk at room temperature
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cubed and at room temperature
Nonstick cooking spray

For the cranberry butter:

4 cups (1 pound) fresh cranberries
1 cup sugar
2 cups (1 pound) unsalted butter, softened.

1. Use an electric mixer, fitted with dough hook if possible, or a paddle. In mixers bowl, combine yeast with 1/4 cup tepid water and a pinch of sugar. Stir until yeast dissolves; let stand until mixture gets foamy, about 10 minutes.

2. Add milk, eggs and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar. Mix on a low speed until mixture is combined.

3. Add flour 1/2 cup at a time, mixing for several seconds after each addition. Sprinkle in the salt and mix until dough comes together in a ball, 3 to 5 minutes. With mixer running at a medium speed, add cubes of butter one at a time. Mix until butter is completely incorporated, and dough is glossy and comes away from sides of bowl, about 5 minutes.

4. Spray a bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Form dough into a loose ball and place it in bowl. Lightly spray plastic wrap and cover dough loosely with it. Allow dough to rest at room temperature for 2 1/2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

5. While dough is rising, make cranberry butter. Place cranberries in a medium saucepan over a low heat. Add 1/2 cup water and sprinkle in the sugar. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or until berries are mushy and water evaporates. Transfer to a bowl to cool.

6. Place softened butter in bowl of an electric mixer and beat on a low speed with paddle attachment. Add cranberries and beat until well combined. Keep butter covered with plastic wrap at room temperature until ready to use.

7. Lightly spray 2 (12-cup) muffin tins with nonstick cooking spray. When dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll each eighth into a 6-inch-long cylinder. Set one aside and cover remaining 7 cylinders with plastic wrap to prevent drying while you work.

8. Cut first cylinder into 6 equal round pieces about 1 inch thick. Roll each piece of dough into a ball and flatten with your hands into a 2 1/2-inch round. Spread a generous amount of cranberry butter (about 2 teaspoons) on the face of each round and place each in a muffin cup, butter side up. Repeat this process with second cylinder of dough, this time placing the rounds butter side down on top of rounds in tin. Using your thumb, gently press center of each roll, making an indentation in middle. Place a dot of cranberry butter in each indentation. Repeat with remaining dough. Loosely cover muffin tins with plastic wrap.

9. Allow rolls to rise until tops are puffed up to edge of muffin tin, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Uncover and bake rolls until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Turn rolls out of muffin tins and brush tops with more cranberry butter. Serve warm with additional cranberry butter on the side.

Yield: 24 rolls.

To make ahead: Assemble rolls in muffin tins and refrigerate, covered, overnight. Let them stand at room temperature until puffed, 2 to 3 hours, then bake as directed. Or assemble rolls in muffin tins and freeze, covered, for up to 2 weeks. Defrost rolls in refrigerator for 8 hours, or overnight.

    * 8  parsley sprigs
    * 1/2  teaspoon  dried marjoram
    * 1  cup  all-purpose flour
    * Fat-skimmed oven-roasted or barbecued turkey drippings (optional)
    * Salt and pepper

Preparation

1. Rinse giblets and neck. Wrap liver airtight and chill to add later, or save for other uses.

2. In a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, combine giblets, neck, 10 cups broth, wine, onions, carrots, celery, parsley, and marjoram. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until gizzard is very tender when pierced, about 1 1/2 hours. If desired, add the liver and simmer 10 more minutes.

3. Meanwhile, in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat, stir flour until it's golden brown and smells richly toasted (but not scorched), 12 to 15 minutes. Pour into a bowl.

4. Pour broth through a fine strainer into a bowl. Discard vegetables. Measure broth. If you have more than 8 cups, boil to reduce; if you have less, add more chicken broth.

5. Pull meat off neck; discard bones. Finely chop meat and giblets (optional).

6. With a whisk, smoothly mix about 3 cups of the simmered broth into flour. Pour into the 5- to 6-quart pan and add remaining broth. If desired, scrape turkey drippings free from roasting or barbecue drip pan and add to broth. Stir over high heat until boiling, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add giblets, if desired, and stir 1 to 2 minutes more. Pour into a bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste.

    * 3 tablespoons olive oil
    * Sea salt
    * Freshly ground black pepper
    * 4 lbs. beef rib bones or short ribs, washed
    * 2 medium onions, peeled, roughly chopped
    * 5 cloves garlic, peeled, roughly chopped
    * 1 tablespoon sweet butter
    * 3 medium Yukon potatoes, peeled, roughly chopped
    * 6 brown mushrooms, washed, sliced
    * 3 large carrots, peeled, cut into thick rounds
    * 2 celery stalks, cut into one-inch lengths
    * 3 broccoli crowns, washed, the florets cut apart
    * 10 Brussels sprouts, trimmed, quartered
    * 1 cup Italian parsley, roughly chopped
    * 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary
    * 4 cups water

Method

    * 1. In a Dutch oven or high-sided frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Brown the ribs on all sides, then remove, and discard the fat.
    * 2. Put 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the pan and brown 1 onion and 2 garlic cloves. Deglaze the pan with the water, add back the ribs, cover, and put into a 400 degree oven for 1 hour. Remove the pan, turn over the ribs, and put back in the oven for another hour.
    * 3. Check the ribs. The meat should be tender and almost falling off the bone. If you're using short ribs, you may need to increase the cooking time another hour and you may have to add another cup of liquid.
    * 4. Put the ribs into one container. Strain out the onions and garlic and discard. Put the braising liquid into a second container and refrigerate.
    * 5. The next day, peel the thick layer of fat off the braising liquid and discard. In the same pan you used the day before, heat the olive oil and butter. Brown the potatoes, mushrooms, and the rest of the onions, add the ribs and the braising liquid. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, broccoli, parsley, the rest of the garlic, and Brussels sprouts. Cover and simmer another 15 minutes.
    * 6. Serve the ribs in bowls with plenty of vegetables, the braising liquid, and a fresh baguette.

4. Add the onion, pepper, celery, garlic, curry powder and 1 tablespoon of the currants to the skillet and sauté over medium-high heat until soft and fragrant, about 7 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and their juices, bring to a boil and simmer over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

5. Spread 1 cup of the tomato sauce in the bottom of an ovenproof casserole large enough to hold the chicken snugly in one layer. Arrange the chicken on top. Pour the remaining sauce over and around the chicken. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 35 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for 15 minutes more.

6. Top with the crumbled bacon, remaining currants and slivered almonds. Serve with cooked rice and any condiments you wish.

In this beautiful salad, the bitter flavor of the endive is countered by the sweet red peppers and broccoli.

2 tablespoons sherry vinegar or champagne vinegar
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
Salt, preferably kosher salt, to taste
1 small garlic clove, minced or pureed
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, or use 2 tablespoons buttermilk and 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

For the salad:

12 ounces broccoli crowns (2 good-size crowns)
1 red bell pepper, roasted if desired
1 tablespoon lightly toasted pine nuts
6 Belgian endives, leaves separated
2 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs, such as parsley, chives, tarragon, chervil
3 ounces feta, crumbled

1. Make the dressing. Mix together the vinegars, salt, garlic, mustard and oil, or use the buttermilk and oil. Set aside.

2. Bring a medium pot of generously salted water to a boil. Fill a bowl with ice water. Add the broccoli to the boiling water, and cook 2 1/2 minutes. Transfer to the ice water, let cool for a few minutes and drain. Dry on paper towels. Toss in a bowl with the red pepper, pine nuts, feta and half the dressing.

3. In a wide salad bowl, toss together the endives, herbs and remaining dressing. Top with the broccoli mixture, and serve.

1 T orange-flower water or rosewater

Filo Layers:
1/2 # walnuts or pistachios
3 T sugar
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 1/2 C unsalted butter
40 filo sheets

Clarify butter:  Clarify the butter by melting and cooking slowly in a sauce pan, skimming off any froth that arises.  When all of the scum is gone, set aside.

Make syrup: Meanwhile, in a sauce pan, combine sugar, water, lemon juice, and spices.  Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and discard zest, cinnamon stick, and cloves.  Stir in the flower water and set aside to cool.

Make the filling and assemble:  In a bowl, stir together nuts, sugar, and cinnamon.  With a wide pastry brush, brush butter over the bottom of a 12\"x15\" pan (or a pan that will exactly fit the filo, if you have one).  Lay a filo sheet in the pan and brush with butter; repeat with 4 more sheets.  Top with 1/6 of the nut mixture. Continue layering: 5 filo sheets, each one brushed with butter, then more nut mixture.  You should finish with filo on top.  Butter the top layer generously.  Cover and chill the baklava for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350F.

Cut and Bake:  Using a sharp knife and starting from one corner of the pan, cut the baklava into 25-30 diamond shapes (or whatever size/shapes you want).  Bake for 30 minutes, then reduce heat to 300F and bake until the top is golden, 15-20 minutes longer.  Remove from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup over the hot filo layers.

1/2 cup (1 stick) very cold unsalted butter, diced
1 egg yolk, lightly beaten.

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

2. In a large, ovenproof pan fitted with a lid, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-low heat. Add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 10 minutes.

3. Add the carrots, celery, mushrooms and remaining 2 tablespoons butter and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms are dark in color and the moisture released by them has evaporated, about 15 minutes.

4. Season the beef pieces all over with salt and pepper. Add the beef, flour and rosemary to the pan and cook over high heat, stirring often, for about 5 minutes.

5. Add enough Guinness to just cover the beef. Cover the pan and put it in the oven for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and stir. Return to the oven and cook for 1 hour more. If it remains thin, set the pan over medium-low heat, remove the lid and reduce the liquid. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Fold in about half the Cheddar.

6. While the stew is cooking, prepare the pastry: sift together the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Using a pastry cutter or your hands, quickly work the butter into the dough until it is the texture of coarse meal. Add ice water, a splash at a time, until a firm dough forms.

	parsnips , peeled and halved crosswise, thin end halved lengthwise, thick end quartered lengthwise
	Brussels sprouts , blemished leaves removed and left whole

Instructions

1. Mix salt and seasonings in small bowl.

2. Spear brisket about thirty times per side with meat fork or metal skewer. Rub each side evenly with salt mixture; place in 2-gallon-size zipper-lock bag, forcing out as much air as possible. Place in pan large enough to hold it (a jelly roll pan works well), cover with second, similar-size pan, and weight with two bricks or heavy cans of similar weight. Refrigerate 5 to 7 days, turning once a day.

3. Choose 7-8 pounds of vegetables of your choice from categories 1 and 2, prepared as described in the ingredient listing.

4. Rinse the brisket and pat it dry. Bring the brisket to boil with water to cover by 1/2 to 1 inch in large soup kettle or stockpot (at least 8 quarts), skimming any scum that rises to surface. Cover and simmer until skewer inserted in thickest part of brisket slides out with ease, 2 to 3 hours.

5. Heat oven to 200 degrees. Transfer meat to large platter, ladling about 1 cup cooking liquid over it to keep it moist. Cover with foil and set in oven.

6. Add vegetables from category 1 to kettle and bring to boil; cover and simmer until vegetables begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Add vegetables from category 2 and bring to boil; cover and simmer until all vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer.
 
7. Meanwhile, remove meat from oven and cut across the grain into 1/4-inch slices.

8. Transfer vegetables to meat platter, moisten with additional broth, and serve.

9. Serve this dish with horseradish, either plain or mixed with whipped or sour cream, or with grainy mustard.

Serve 4 to 6.   Published September 1, 2006.

To keep the dish from becoming greasy, it is important to remove excess fat from the chicken thighs and trim the skin. To use long-grain rice instead of medium-grain, increase the water to 3/4 cup in step 2.

Ingredients

6 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 tablespoons)
	Table salt
1/2 	teaspoon dried oregano
1 	tablespoon distilled white vinegar plus 2 additional teaspoons
	Ground black pepper
8 	bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (3 1/2 to 4 pounds), trimmed of excess skin and fat
2 	tablespoons olive oil
1 	medium onion , chopped fine (about 1 cup)
1 	small green bell pepper , stemmed, seeded, and chopped fine (about 3/4 cup)
1/4 	teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
1/4 	cup minced fresh cilantro leaves
	1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce
1 3/4 	cups low-sodium chicken broth
1/4 	cup water
3 	cups medium-grain rice (see note above)
1/2 	cup green olives (manzanilla), pitted and halved
1 	tablespoon capers
1/2 	cup jarred pimentos , cut into 1/4 by 2-inch strips
	Lemon wedges , for serving
Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Place garlic and 1 teaspoon salt in large bowl; using rubber spatula, mix to make smooth paste. Add oregano, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper to garlic-salt mixture; stir to combine. Place chicken in bowl with marinade. Coat chicken pieces evenly with marinade; set aside for 15 minutes.

2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, green pepper, and pepper flakes; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften, 4 to 8 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons cilantro; stir to combine. Push vegetables to sides of pot and increase heat to medium-high. Add chicken to clearing in center of pot, skin side down, in even layer. Cook, without moving chicken, until outer layer of meat becomes opaque, 2 to 4 minutes. (If chicken begins to brown, reduce heat to medium.) Using tongs, flip chicken and cook on second side until opaque, 2 to 4 minutes more. Add tomato sauce, broth, and water; stir to combine. Bring to simmer; cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes.

3. Add rice, olives, capers, and 3/4 teaspoon salt; stir well. Bring to simmer, cover, and place pot in oven. After 10 minutes, remove pot from oven and stir chicken and rice once from bottom up. Return pot to oven. After another 10 minutes, stir once more, adding 1/4 cup water if rice appears dry and bottom of pot is beginning to burn. Cover and return pot to oven; cook until rice has absorbed all liquid and is tender but still holds its shape and temperature of chicken registers 175 degrees on instant-read thermometer, about 10 minutes longer.

4. Using tongs, remove chicken from pot; replace lid and set pot aside. Remove and discard chicken skin; using 2 spoons, pull meat off bones into large chunks. Using fingers, remove remaining fat or dark veins from chicken pieces. Place chicken in large bowl and toss with remaining tablespoon olive oil, remaining 2 teaspoons vinegar, remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro, and pimentos; season with salt and pepper to taste. Place chicken on top of rice, cover, and let stand until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Serve, passing lemon wedges separately.

1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
2 limes, 1 halved and 1 cut into wedges
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon canned chipotle pepper, finely chopped (optional)
1/2 cup flour, preferably Wondra or other fine-milled flour
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup peanut oil, plus a splash more for greasing pan
Pat of butter
1 pound flounder or any firm white-fleshed fish, cut across the grain of the flesh into strips about 1/2 inch wide by 3 inches long
12 6-inch fresh corn tortillas
2 cups shredded green cabbage
A saucy hot sauce, like Tapatio or Franks.

1. In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, onion, garlic, cilantro and jalapeño (if using).

2. In a small bowl, whisk the mayonnaise and sour cream until combined. Season to taste with the halved lime, salt, pepper and chipotle (if using).

3. In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, chili powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons each of kosher salt and black pepper. Pour the milk into another medium bowl, and place the fish into it.

4. Pour 1/4 cup of the peanut oil into a 12-inch frying pan and place over medium-high heat until it shimmers and is about to smoke. Remove the fish pieces from the milk bath and dredge them lightly through the flour mixture, shaking to remove excess. Add the butter to the pan. Place some fish pieces in the oil, without crowding them, and cook until deep golden brown on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn carefully and cook for 1 minute more. Remove to a warmed, paper-towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with the remaining fish.

5. Meanwhile, lightly grease a skillet with a drizzle of oil and set over medium heat. Heat the tortillas, one or two at a time, until they are soft and hot. Keep them warm, wrapped in a dish towel.

6. Fill each tortilla with 3 pieces of fish, browned side up, followed by tomato salsa and a pinch of cabbage. Drizzle with the cream sauce. Serve 2 to 3 tacos per person, with lime wedges and hot sauce on the side.

Making The Cilantro Cumin Cream

Combine the first three ingredients in a food processor. Stir in cumin and garlic. Salt and pepper to taste. Let flavors meld while making crab cakes.

Making The Crab Cakes

Combine all ingredients in order. Make small crab cakes, about 2 inches in diameter, a little more than 1/8 cup each. Heat 1 tablespoon light olive oil with a little butter on medium heat, and cook cakes until a golden crust forms  about 3 minutes for the first side, 2 minutes for the second. Add more oil or butter as needed for subsequent cakes (but don't overdo it).

Recommended over a very lightly dressed early greens salad, including baby arugula and baby amaranth greens. Roasted new potatoes are great, too. Serve cilantro cream on side.$$,1,@cat4,@subcat6,PARSEDATETIME('2009-04-05', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Time: 30 minutes

FOR THE PANCAKES:
3 medium zucchini, shredded
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 large eggs, beaten
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 cup crumbled feta cheese
3 scallions, finely chopped
1/3 cup finely chopped dill
1 teaspoon baking powder
4 to 6 tablespoons vegetable oil, more as needed

FOR THE YOGURT SAUCE:
2/3 cup plain yogurt
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt.

1. Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Place zucchini in a colander over a bowl, and mix with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Allow to drain for five minutes. Transfer to a cloth kitchen towel, and squeeze hard to extract as much moisture as possible. Squeeze a second time; volume will shrink to about half the original.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine zucchini and eggs. Using a fork, mix well. Add flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, olive oil, feta, scallions, dill and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Mix well, add baking powder, and mix again.

3. Place a cast iron skillet or other heavy skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and heat until shimmering. Place heaping tablespoons of zucchini batter in pan several inches apart, allowing room to spread. Flatten them with a spatula if necessary; pancakes should be about 3/8 inch thick and about 3 inches in diameter. Fry until golden on one side, then turn and fry again until golden on other side. Repeat once or twice, frying about 5 to 6 minutes total, so pancakes get quite crisp. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels, and keep warm in oven. Continue frying remaining batter, adding more oil to pan as needed. Serve hot.

Serves 8.

For the brine:

3 cups cultured buttermilk (see note)
1/4 cup kosher salt
1/4 cup hot sauce, like Frank's
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
10 sage leaves, thinly sliced
2 chickens, each cut into 8 pieces

For the breading:

4 cups flour
Kosher salt
3 eggs
4 cups buttermilk
3 cups finely ground white or yellow cornmeal
20 leaves sage, minced
1/4 cup dry mustard
2 tablespoons paprika
1/2 cup dried thyme

About 2 quarts vegetable oil

1. Twenty-four hours before cooking, prepare the brine: In a large bowl, whisk 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons water with the remaining brine ingredients until the salt has dissolved. Submerge the chicken pieces in the brine. Cover and refrigerate. (To save space, you can also put the chicken and brine in a large sealable bag.)

2. When ready to cook, prepare the breading by whisking together 2 cups of the flour and 2 teaspoons kosher salt in a medium bowl. In a separate medium bowl, whisk the eggs to break them up, then whisk in the buttermilk. In a large bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 cups of flour, the cornmeal, sage, mustard, paprika, thyme and 1 tablespoon kosher salt.

3. Dredge the chicken in the plain flour, then in the buttermilk, then in the cornmeal mixture, taking care not to let the breading get too thick. Let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.

4. Meanwhile, set a large 12-to-14-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and fill with oil to 11/2 inches below the top. Heat until the oil reaches 325 degrees. Working in batches, fry the chicken pieces, turning them 3 or 4 times to create an even, dark-golden crust. Cook until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees, about 10 minutes. (Place a splatter guard over the pan as you fry.)

1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
1&#8260;2 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed lard or unsalted butter, chilled and cut into pieces
2 cups chilled cultured buttermilk, plus more as needed
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted.

1. Set a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees. Sift together the cream of tartar and baking soda to make baking powder.

To make this dish vegetarian, replace the chicken broth with vegetable broth; the test kitchens favorite brand is Swanson Vegetarian Vegetable Broth. Onions can be substituted for the leeks. If substituting onions, use 1 roughly chopped medium onion (1 cup) in the broth and 2 minced medium onions (2 cups) in the risotto. At the end of cooking, you may have up to a cup of broth left over.

INGREDIENTS
Gremolata
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves , stems reserved
2 tablespoons minced fresh mint leaves , stems reserved
1/2 teaspoon finely grated zest from 1 lemon

Risotto
1 pound asparagus , tough ends snapped off and reserved, spears cut on bias into 1/2-inch thick pieces
2 medium leeks , white and light green parts halved lengthwise, washed, and sliced thin (about 4 cups), 2 cups roughly chopped greens reserved (see note)
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth (see note)
3 cups water
5 tablespoons unsalted butter
Table salt and ground black pepper
1/2 cup frozen peas
2 medium garlic cloves , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
1 1/2 cups Arborio rice (see note)
1 cup dry white wine
1 1/2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese (about 3/4 cup), plus extra for serving
2 teaspoons juice from 1 lemon

INSTRUCTIONS
1. For the Gremolata: Combine ingredients in small bowl and set aside.

2. For the Risotto: Chop tough asparagus ends and leek greens into rough 1/2-inch pieces. Bring chopped vegetables, reserved parsley and mint stems, broth, and water to boil in large saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer 20 minutes. Strain broth through fine-mesh strainer into medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Return strained broth to saucepan; cover and set over low heat to keep broth warm.

3. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in large Dutch oven over medium heat. When foaming subsides, add asparagus spears, pinch of salt, and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until asparagus is crisp-tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Add peas and continue to cook 1 minute. Transfer vegetables to plate and set aside.

4. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in now-empty Dutch oven over medium heat. When foaming subsides, add leeks, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until grains are translucent around edges, about 3 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring frequently, until fully absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes.

5. When wine is fully absorbed, add 3 cups hot broth to rice. Simmer, stirring every 3 to 4 minutes, until liquid is absorbed and bottom of pan is almost dry, about 12 minutes.

6. Stir in about 1/2 cup hot broth and cook, stirring constantly, until absorbed, about 3 minutes; repeat with additional broth 3 or 4 times until rice is al dente. Off heat, stir in remaining tablespoon butter, Parmesan, and lemon juice; gently fold in asparagus and peas. If desired, add up to 1/4 cup additional hot broth to loosen texture of risotto.

Agua fresca is a light fruit drink popular throughout Mexico. Its simply made by blending fruit with water, a bit of sugar and a little lime juice. Begin with sweet, juicy melon, or your agua fresca wont have much flavor.

4 cups diced, peeled ripe watermelon or cantaloupe
3 cups water
2 to 3 teaspoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon sugar

1. Blend together the watermelon or cantaloupe with 1 1/2 cups of the water, the lime juice and the sugar at high speed until smooth. Strain through a medium strainer into a large pitcher or bowl. Stir in the remaining water. Refrigerate for 1 hour or longer. Fill a glass with ice, pour in the agua fresca, garnish with a mint sprig, and serve.

Yield: Four servings.

Variations:

* Stir an additional cup of finely chopped fruit into the strained blended drink and refrigerate for 1 hour or longer.

INSERT INTO RECIPE (ID, TITLE, BODY, OWNER_ID, CATEGORY_ID, SUB_CATEGORY_ID, DATE_CREATED, VERSION) VALUES (seq_recipe.nextval, $$Peter Reinhart's Napoletana Pizza Dough Recipe$$, $$4 1/2 cups (20.25 ounces) unbleached high-gluten, bread, or all-purpose flour, chilled
    1 3/4 (.44 ounce) teaspoons salt
    1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast
    1/4 cup (2 ounces) olive oil (optional)
    1 3/4 cups (14 ounces) water, ice cold (40°F)
    Semolina flour OR cornmeal for dusting

1. Stir together the flour, salt, and instant yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). With a large metal spoon, stir in the oil and the cold water until the flour is all absorbed (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment), If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. If you are using an electric mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour just until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of the bowl, dribble in a tea- spoon or two of cold water. The finished dough will be springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky, and register 50 to 55F.

2. Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Prepare a sheet pan by lining it with baking parchment and misting the parchment with spray oil (or lightly oil the parchment). Using a metal dough scraper, cut the dough into 6 equal pieces (or larger if you are comfortable shaping large pizzas), You can dip the scraper into the water between cuts to keep the dough from sticking to it, Sprinkle flour over the dough. Make sure your hands are dry and then flour them. Lift each piece and gently round it into a ball. If the dough sticks to your hands, dip your hands into the flour again. Transfer the dough balls to the sheet pan, Mist the dough generously with spray oil and slip the pan into a food-grade plastic bag.

3. Put the pan into the refrigerator overnight to rest the dough, or keep for up to 3 days. (Note: If you want to save some of the dough for future baking, you can store the dough balls in a zippered freezer bag. Dip each dough ball into a bowl that has a few tablespoons of oil in it, rolling the dough in the oil, and then put each ball into a separate bag. You can place the bags into the freezer for up to 3 months. Transfer them to the refrigerator the day before you plan to make pizza.)

4. On the day you plan to make the pizza, remove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before making the pizza. Before letting the dough rest at room temperature for 2 hours, dust the counter with flour, and then mist the counter with spray oil. Place the dough balls on top of the floured counter and sprinkle them with flour; dust your hands with flour. Gently press the dough into flat disks about 1/2 inch thick and 5 inches in diameter. Sprinkle the dough with flour, mist it again with spray oil, and cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag. Now let rest for 2 hours.

5. At least 45 minutes before making the pizza, place a baking stone either on the floor of the oven (for gas ovens), or on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Heat the oven as hot as possible, up to 800F (most home ovens will go only to 500 to 550F, but some will go higher). If you do not have a baking stone, you can use the back of a sheet pan, but do not preheat the pan.

6. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal. Make the pizzas one at a time. Dip your hands, including the backs of your hands and knuckles, in flour and lift I piece of dough by getting under it with a pastry scraper. Very gently lay the dough across your fists and carefully stretch it by bouncing the dough in a circular motion on your hands, carefully giving it a little stretch with each bounce. If it begins to stick to your hands, lay it down on the floured counter and reflour your hands, then continue shaping it. Once the dough has expanded outward, move to a full toss as shown on page 208. If you have trouble tossing the dough, or if the dough keeps springing back, let it rest for 5 to 20 minutes so the gluten can relax, and try again. You can also resort to using a rolling pin, though this isn't as effective as the toss method.

7. When the dough is stretched out to your satisfaction (about 9 to 12 inches in diameter for a 6-ounce piece of dough), lay it on the peel or pan, making sure there is enough semolina flour or cornmeal to allow it to slide. Lightly top it with sauce and then with your other top- pings, remembering that the best pizzas are topped with a less-is-more philosophy. The American \"kitchen sink\" approach is counterproductive, as it makes the crust more difficult to bake. A few, usually no more than 3 or 4 toppings, including sauce and cheese is sufficient.

8. Slide the topped pizza onto the stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan) and close the door. Wait 2 minutes, then take a peek. If it needs to be rotated 180 degrees for even baking, do so. The pizza should take about 5 to 8 minutes to bake. If the top gets done before the bottom, you will need to move the stone to a lower self before the next round. if the bottom crisps before the cheese caramelizes, then you will need to raise the stone for subsequent bakes.

9. Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Wait 3 to 5 minutes before slicing and serving, to allow the cheese to set slightly.

Makes six 6-ounce pizza crusts.

Makes four 9-inch pizzas.   Published July 1, 2005.  

The pizzas cook very quickly on the grill, so before you begin grilling them, be sure to have all the equipment and ingredients you need at hand. Equipment includes a pizza peel (or a rimless baking sheet), a pair of tongs, a paring knife, a large cutting board, and a pastry brush; ingredients include all the toppings and a small bowl of flour for dusting. Timing and coordination are crucial; if you are unsure of your skill level, try cooking the first two pizzas one at a time, then work up to cooking the final two in tandem. The pizzas are best served hot off the grill but can be kept warm for 20 to 30 minutes on a wire rack in a 200-degree oven.

Dough
2 	tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 	cup water (8 ounces), room temperature
2 	cups bread flour (11 ounces), plus more for work surface
1 	tablespoon whole wheat flour (optional)
2 	teaspoons sugar
1 1/4 	teaspoons table salt
1 	teaspoon instant yeast

Topping
1 1/2 	pounds medium plum tomatoes (5 to 6), cored, seeded, and cut into 1/2-inch dice
3/4 	teaspoon table salt
6 	ounces fontina cheese , shredded (about 2 cups)
1 1/2 	ounces Parmesan cheese , finely grated (about 3/4 cup)
1 	recipe Spicy Garlic Oil (see associated recipe)
1/2 	cup chopped fresh basil
	Coarse salt


    1. FOR THE CRUST: Combine oil and water in liquid measuring cup. In food processor fitted with plastic dough blade or metal blade, process bread flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, salt, and yeast until combined, about 5 seconds. With machine running, slowly add liquid through feed tube; continue to process until dough forms tacky, elastic ball that clears sides of workbowl, about 1 1/2 minutes. If dough ball does not form, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time and process until dough ball forms. Spray medium bowl lightly with nonstick cooking spray or rub lightly with oil. Transfer dough to bowl and press down to flatten surface; cover tightly with plastic wrap and set in draft-free spot until doubled in volume, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

      2. When dough has doubled, press down gently to deflate; turn dough out onto work surface and divide into 4 equal-sized pieces. With cupped palm, form each piece into smooth, tight ball. Set dough balls on well-floured work surface. Press dough rounds with hand to flatten; cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.

      3. FOR THE TOPPING: Meanwhile, toss tomatoes and table salt in medium bowl; transfer to colander and drain 30 minutes (wipe out and reserve bowl). Shake colander to drain off excess liquid; transfer tomatoes to now-empty bowl and set aside. Combine cheeses in second medium bowl and set aside.

      4. Gently stretch dough rounds into disks about 1/2 inch thick and 5 to 6 inches in diameter. Working one piece at a time and keeping the rest covered, roll out each disk to 1/8-inch thickness, 9 to 10 inches in diameter, on well-floured sheet of parchment paper, dusting with additional flour as needed to prevent sticking. (If dough shrinks when rolled out, cover with plastic wrap and let rest until relaxed, 10 to 15 minutes.) Dust surface of rolled dough with flour and set aside. Repeat with remaining dough, stacking sheets of rolled dough on top of each other (with parchment in between) and covering stack with plastic wrap; set aside until grill is ready.

      5. Lightly flour pizza peel; invert 1 dough round onto peel, gently stretching it as needed to retain shape (do not stretch dough too thin; thin spots will burn quickly). Peel off and discard parchment; carefully slide round onto hot side of grill. Immediately repeat with another dough round. Cook (with grill lid down) until tops are covered with bubbles (pierce larger bubbles with paring knife) and bottoms are grill marked and charred in spots, 2 to 3 minutes; while rounds cook, check undersides and slide to cool area of grill if browning too quickly. Transfer crusts to cutting board browned sides up. Repeat with 2 remaining dough rounds.

      6. Brush 2 crusts generously with Spicy Garlic Oil; top each evenly with one-quarter of cheese mixture and one-quarter of tomatoes. Return pizzas to grill and cover grill with lid; cook until bottoms are well browned and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes, checking bottoms frequently to prevent burning. Transfer pizzas to cutting board; repeat with remaining 2 crusts. Sprinkle pizzas with basil and coarse salt to taste; cut into wedges and serve immediately.

This classic risotto is flooded with fresh herbs at the very end of cooking. Serve it as a main dish or a side. Use a combination of sweet herbs and vivid-tasting salad greens, like wild arugula.

7 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 cups finely chopped fresh herbs, such as parsley, tarragon, chives, chervil, dill, basil, chives and arugula (4 cups leaves)
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2/3 cup finely chopped onion or leek
Salt, preferably kosher salt, to taste
1 1/2 cups arborio or carnaroli rice
1/2 cup dry white wine, such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc
Freshly ground pepper
1 teaspoon finely chopped lemon zest
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan

1. Put your stock or broth into a saucepan, and bring it to a simmer on the stove, with a ladle nearby or in the pot. Make sure that it is well seasoned. Combine the herbs and one of the minced garlic cloves in a bowl, and set aside.

2. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a wide, heavy skillet or saucepan. Add the onion or leek and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook gently until it is just tender, about three minutes. Do not brown.

3. Stir in the rice and the remaining three cloves of garlic, and stir just until the grains of rice become separate and begin to crackle. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until it is absorbed.

4. Begin adding the simmering stock, a couple of ladlefuls (about 1/2 cup) at a time. The stock should just cover the rice and should be bubbling, not too slowly but not too quickly. When the rice is just tender all the way through but still chewy, usually in 20 to 25 minutes, it is done. Taste now and correct seasoning.

5. Add another ladleful of stock to the rice. Stir in the herbs, pepper, lemon zest and juice, and Parmesan, and remove from the heat. The mixture should be creamy. If you put some on a plate and tilt the plate the mound of rice should flatten out. Serve right away.

Yield: Serves four.

Advance preparation: You can begin up to several hours before serving. Proceed with the recipe, and cook halfway through step 4  that is, for about 15 minutes. The rice should still be hard when you remove it from the heat, and there should not be any liquid in the pan. Spread it in an even layer in the pan, and keep it away from the heat until you resume cooking. If the pan is not wide enough for you to spread the rice in a thin layer, transfer it to a sheet pan. Fifteen minutes before serving, resume cooking as instructed. $$,1,@cat8,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2009-06-23', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

MOSTLY VEGAN SALADS

1. Cube watermelon and combine with tomato chunks, basil and basic vinaigrette. You can substitute peach for the watermelon or the tomato (but not both, O.K.?). You can also add bacon or feta, but there goes the vegan-ness.

2. Mix wedges of tomatoes and peaches, add slivers of red onion, a few red-pepper flakes and cilantro. Dress with olive oil and lime or lemon juice. Astonishing.

3. A nice cucumber salad: Slice cucumbers thin (if theyre fat and old, peel and seed them first), toss with red onions and salt, then let sit for 20 to 60 minutes. Rinse, dry, dress with cider vinegar mixed with Dijon mustard; no oil necessary.

4. Shave raw asparagus stalks with a vegetable peeler. Discard the tough first pass of the peeler  i.e., the peel  but do use the tips, whole. Dress with lemon vinaigrette and coarse salt. (Chopped hard-boiled eggs optional but good.)

5. Grate or very thinly slice Jerusalem artichokes; mix with pitted and chopped oil-cured olives, olive oil, lemon juice and a sprinkling of coarsely ground cumin. Unusual and wonderful.

6. Sichuan slaw: Toss bean sprouts, shredded carrots and celery, minced fresh chili, soy sauce, sesame oil and a bit of sugar. Top with chopped peanuts and chopped basil, mint and/or cilantro. (The full trio is best.)

7. Grate carrots, toast some sunflower seeds, and toss with blueberries, olive oil, lemon juice and plenty of black pepper. Sweet, sour, crunchy, soft.

8. Chop or slice radishes (or jicama, or the ever-surprising kohlrabi) and combine with chopped or sliced unripe (i.e., still crunchy) mango, lime juice and mint or cilantro.

9. Chop or slice jicama (or radishes or kohlrabi) and mango and mix with coconut milk, lime juice, curry powder and cilantro or mint.

10. Cook whole grape tomatoes in olive oil over high heat until they brown lightly, sprinkling with curry powder. Cool a bit, then toss with chopped arugula, loads of chopped mint and lime juice.

11. Chop and steam baby or grown-up bok choy until crisp-tender, then shock it in ice water. Drain, then toss with halved cherry tomatoes, capers, olive oil and lemon juice.

12. Combine sliced fennel and prune plums; serve with vinaigrette spiked with minced ginger. Nice pairing.

13. A red salad: Combine tomato wedges with halved strawberries, basil leaves, shaved Parmesan and balsamic vinegar.

14. A classic Moroccan thing: Thinly slice carrots, or grate or shred them (the food processor makes quick work of this). Toss with toasted cumin seeds, olive oil, lemon juice and cilantro. Raisins are good in here, too. There is no better use of raw carrots.

15. Cut cherry or grape tomatoes in half; toss with soy sauce, a bit of dark sesame oil and basil or cilantro. I love this  the tomato juice-soy thing is incredible.

16. Slice fennel and crisp apple about the same thickness (your choice). Combine, then dress with mustardy vinaigrette and chopped parsley. Come fall, this will be even better.

17. With thanks to Szechuan Gourmet restaurant: Finely chop celery and mix with a roughly equal amount of pressed or smoked tofu, chopped. Dress with peanut oil warmed with chili flakes and Sichuan peppercorns, then mixed with soy sauce.

18. Roughly chop cooked or canned chickpeas (you can pulse them, carefully, in a food processor) and toss with olive oil, lemon juice, lots of chopped fresh parsley and mint, and a few chopped tomatoes. Call this chickpea tabbouleh.

19. Mix cooked cannellini or other white beans, chopped cherry or grape tomatoes and arugula or baby spinach. Lightly toast sliced garlic in olive oil with rosemary and red pepper flakes; cool slightly, add lemon zest or juice or both, then pour over beans.

20. Shred Napa cabbage and radishes. The dressing is roasted peanuts, lime juice, peanut or other oil, cilantro and fresh or dried chili, all whizzed in a blender. Deliciousness belies ease.

21. Dice cucumbers (if theyre fat and old, peel and seed them first) and toss with cubes of avocado, a little mirin (or honey, but then its not vegan), rice vinegar and soy sauce. (You could mix in a little lump crab meat, really not vegan, even rice, and call it a California roll salad.)

22. Thinly slice button mushrooms; toss with finely chopped carrots and celery and mix with mung bean sprouts. Finish with peanut or olive oil, sherry vinegar, a little soy sauce and minced ginger. (This is a super vinaigrette, by the way.)

23. Thinly slice some cucumbers (if theyre fat and old, peel and seed them first), red onions, radishes and fresh chili pepper. Soak for a few minutes in equal amounts vinegar and water, with some salt and sugar. When they taste lightly pickled, drain and serve, alone or over rice.

24. Blanch spinach, then drain and shock in ice water. Squeeze it dry, chop it and toss it with toasted pine nuts, raisins, olive oil and a tiny bit of balsamic vinegar. Capers are good, too. Quite elegant, actually.

25. Combine chopped bell peppers, tomatoes, red onion, chilies and cilantro, then toss with corn tortilla strips, toasted in a 350-degree oven until crisp (or yes, use packaged chips; why not?). Dust with chili powder and lots of lime juice.

26. Combine mushroom caps and thinly sliced red onions with olive oil; broil gently until tender and browned. Toss with a lot of chopped fresh parsley or basil (or both) and a simple vinaigrette. Some chopped escarole, arugula or watercress is good, too.

27. Cook whole, unpeeled eggplant in a dry, hot skillet or on a grill, turning occasionally, until completely collapsed and soft. Chop and toss with toasted pita, toasted pine nuts, cooked white beans and halved cherry tomatoes. Dress with olive oil, lemon juice and lots of black pepper. Or a (non-vegan) yogurt dressing is good, especially one laced with tahini.

28. Toss mâche or another soft green with toasted slivered almonds and roughly chopped fresh figs. Thin some almond butter with water and sherry vinegar to taste and use as a dressing. Some will like this with fresh goat cheese.

29. Pit and halve cherries (or halve and pit cherries), then cook gently with olive oil and a little balsamic vinegar until they break down. Toss with chopped radicchio, endive, escarole or a combination, some toasted hazelnuts and more oil and vinegar, if necessary.

30. Fast, grown-up potato salad: Boil bite-size red potatoes. While still warm, dress them with olive oil, lemon juice, whole grain mustard, capers and parsley. Chopped shallots, bell peppers, etc., all welcome, too.

31. Roast beets whole (or buy them precooked), then slice or cube and toss with a little chopped garlic (or a lot of roasted garlic), toasted walnuts, orange juice and olive oil.

32. Same deal with the beets, but toss with cooked corn, arugula, olive oil, sherry vinegar and chopped shallots.

33. The real five-bean: Chickpeas, cannellini or other white beans, kidney or other red beans, steamed string beans and steamed yellow wax beans. Toss with vinaigrette, chopped scallions or red onion, and parsley.

34. Grill quartered romaine hearts, radicchio and/or endive. Drizzle with olive oil and sherry vinegar, and add dill and chopped shallots. Teeny-tiny croutons are great on this.

35. Combine cooked or canned black beans with shredded cabbage and this vinaigrette: olive oil, fresh orange juice, not much sherry vinegar, ground cumin.

36. Mix cooked or canned chickpeas with toasted coconut, shredded carrots, chopped celery, curry powder, olive oil, lime juice and cilantro.

VEGETARIAN SALADS

37. Cube smoked tofu, then brush it with a mixture of honey and orange juice; broil until browned. Toss with chopped cucumbers, radishes and peas or pea shoots; drizzle with soy sauce and lime juice.

38. Cube watermelon; combine with roughly chopped mint, crumbled feta, sliced red onion and chopped Kalamata olives. Dress lightly with olive oil and lemon juice. Despite saltiness of feta and olives, this may need salt.

39. Yucatecan street food as salad: Roast fresh corn kernels in a pan with a little oil; toss with cayenne or minced chilis, lime juice and a little queso fresco. Cherry tomatoes are optional.

40. Slice cucumber and top with capers, olive oil, lots of pepper and little dollops of fresh ricotta. Note: cucumbers, ricotta and oil must all be really good.

41. Halve avocados and scoop out some but not all of their flesh. Roughly chop and toss with black beans, queso fresco, cilantro, chopped tomatillos and lime juice. Serve in the meaty avocado shells.

42. Trim crusts if necessary from day-or-two-old bread (or even three-day-old bread), cube and marinate in black olive tapenade thinned with more olive oil. Add chopped capers and toss with tomatoes, basil and mozzarella. (Anchovies optional.)

43. Grate raw beets (use the food processor to avoid ruining everything within spattering distance) and toss with watercress or arugula. Top with sherry vinaigrette and a little goat cheese. Especially obvious, perhaps, but also especially popular.

44. Make a crisp grilled cheese sandwich, with good bread and not too much good cheese. Let it cool, then cut into croutons. Put them on anything, but especially tomato and basil salad. This you will do forever.

45. Halve or quarter cooked artichoke hearts (the best are fresh and grilled, but you can use canned or frozen) and combine with cherry tomatoes, bits of feta or Parmesan or both, olive oil and lemon juice.

46. Sauté mushrooms and shallots in olive oil. Add a lot of spinach, chopped unless the leaves are small. When it wilts, stir in parsley and crumbled blue cheese. Feels like a steakhouse side-dish salad.

47. Thinly slice raw button mushrooms; combine with sliced or shaved Parmesan, parsley and a vinaigrette of olive oil, sherry vinegar and shallots.

48. Toss roughly chopped dandelion greens (or arugula or watercress) with chopped preserved lemon, chickpeas, crumbled feta and olive oil. (Before you start cursing me out, heres a quick way to make preserved lemons: chop whole lemons and put in a bowl with the juice of another lemon or two, sprinkle with a fair amount of salt and let sit for an hour or so.)

49. Toss greens with walnuts, blue cheese and raspberries; drizzle with a simple vinaigrette. Sell for $14 a serving.

50. Its puttanesca-ish: Egg salad with pitted black olives, chopped tomatoes, capers, anchovies (optional), a tiny bit of garlic and some red onion; mayonnaise as needed.

51. Arrange sliced ripe tomatoes and hard-boiled eggs on a platter; scatter a handful of chopped pitted green olives on top. Drizzle with a dressing made with olive oil, sherry vinegar and a teaspoon of pimentón.

52. Chop hard-boiled eggs and mix with just enough mayonnaise to bind; spoon into endive leaves. Top each with a small canned sardine and drizzle with a vinaigrette of olive oil, lemon juice and mustard.

53. Peel beets and grate them in a food processor. Mix equal parts plain yogurt and tahini, and toss with the beets along with lemon juice and zaatar (a mixture of toasted sesame seeds, dried green herbs and ground sumac; you can make it yourself using dried thyme).

54. Slice roasted red peppers (if you must use canned, try to find piquillos) and fresh mozzarella. Toss with cooked white beans, olive oil, red wine vinegar, a chopped shallot and fresh rosemary or parsley.

SALADS WITH SEAFOOD

55. Mix watercress with chopped smoked salmon, avocado, red onion and capers. Make a vinaigrette with olive oil, sherry vinegar and mustard powder.

56. Salade niçoise, sort of: On or around a bed of greens, make mounds of olives, cooked new potatoes and green beans (warm or at room temperature), good tomatoes, capers, fennel slivers, hard-cooked eggs and good quality Italian canned tuna. None of these is crucial; you get the idea. Serve with vinaigrette or aioli.

57. Toss cubes of day-or-more-old good bread with soy sauce, chopped sautéed shrimp, chopped radishes and cilantro. Like a weird shrimp toast panzanella.

58. Sear tuna until rare (for that matter, you could leave it raw) and cut it into small cubes. Toss with shredded jicama or radish and shredded Napa cabbage; season with mirin, soy sauce and cilantro. Avocado and/or wasabi paste are great with this, too.

59. Sear tuna, or use good canned tuna. Chop it up and mix with chopped olives, capers, tomatoes, parsley and olive oil.

60. Ditto on the tuna. Mix with chopped apples, halved seedless grapes, chopped red onion, olive oil, a bit of cumin and black pepper.

61. Mix canned salmon (sockeye, or use cooked fresh) with capers, chopped celery, yogurt or mayonnaise, and lemon juice. Serve on greens or in endive leaves.

62. Dust shrimp with chili powder. Sauté in butter or oil (or a combination) with fresh corn kernels and flavorful cooking greens (bok choy is good, as is watercress). Add halved cherry tomatoes and lime juice at the last minute.

63. Sunday brunch salad: Mix diced cucumbers, chopped tomato, minced red onion and capers with bits of smoked salmon. Dress with lemon juice (you wont need much oil, if any). Take a step further by adding croutons of cubed toasted bagels.

64. Alternative Sunday brunch: Shred or chop cucumbers (if theyre fat and old, peel and seed them first), then toss with flaked smoked trout or whitefish, capers, dill, lemon juice and olive oil.

65. In a hot pan, flash-cook cut-up squid in a little olive oil for no more than two minutes. Toss with cooked or canned chickpeas, chopped bell peppers, lemon juice, a little more oil and parsley.

66. In a hot pan, sear sea scallops for a minute or two on each side, depending on size. Slice or chop, then toss with thinly sliced fennel and lemon or orange vinaigrette and some chopped fennel fronds.

67. Bread salad for anchovy lovers: Chop together many anchovies, a few capers, lemon juice and olive oil (or anchovy oil). Toss with cubes of toasted bread and chopped tomatoes or halved cherry or grape tomatoes.

68. Mix crab meat with pan-roasted corn, chopped avocado, halved cherry or grape tomatoes, olive oil, lemon juice and perhaps a bit of cilantro and crumbled ancho chili.

69. Stir-fry small or chopped shrimp in olive or peanut oil with lots of ginger; while still warm, combine with tomato wedges, chopped romaine, cilantro, scallions and lots of lime juice. Good in pita.

SALADS WITH MEAT

70. Shred brussels sprouts in the food processor, preferably with the slicing disk. Toss with vinaigrette and crumbled bacon.

71. Combine sliced green tomatoes and sliced fresh mozzarella; top with roughly chopped basil, olive oil, black pepper and crumbled bacon.

72. Sort-of carpaccio salad: Broil or grill skirt or sirloin steak very rare and slice very thin. Arrange on a plate with tomato wedges, lettuce and lemon juice.

73. Hawaiitalian: Combine pineapple chunks with bits of any cured pork product  cooked guanciale is ideal, or any ham  and a not-too-subtle chili vinaigrette.

74. Julienne red, yellow and orange bell peppers; mix with thinly sliced red onion, olive oil and cooked crumbled sausage or chopped salami.

75. The Little Italy salad: Chop or julienne salami and prosciutto, then toss with cubed mozzarella, chopped tomato, pepperoncini, oil and wine vinegar.

76. Slice fresh figs  many, if you live where they grow  and top with crumbled bacon, balsamic vinegar (the best you have) and crumbled blue cheese.

77. Combine shredded cabbage or lettuce with bits of good turkey, Swiss cheese and rye croutons. Top with good old Russian dressing, call it a turkey sandwich salad and dont knock it until you try it.

78. What happens when your Chicago hot dog falls apart: Toss together tomato wedges, chopped pickles, hot peppers, shredded lettuce and a few slices of broiled or grilled hot dog. Dress with a vinaigrette made with mustard (should be yellow for authenticity, but ...) and celery salt. (You could throw in freshly made croutons; inauthentic, but better than a hot dog bun.)

79. Sear a steak and move it to a cutting board (dont wash the pan); wait a minute or two, then slice. Cut kale (preferably black, also known as Tuscan, or dino kale) into thin ribbons and toss in the pan over high heat for a minute. Turn off the heat, add chopped black olives, olive oil and sherry vinegar. Serve kale with steak on top.

80. Sort-of-Cobb salad: Choose any combination of hard-cooked eggs, chopped prosciutto, cooked chicken, crumbled Gorgonzola, chopped tomatoes, chickpeas or white beans, sliced red onion, olives. Make vinaigrette with capers and anchovies.

81. Soak sliced prune plums or figs in balsamic vinegar for a few minutes, then add olive oil, chopped celery and red onion, shreds of roasted or grilled chicken, chopped fresh marjoram or oregano and chopped almonds. Serve on top of or toss with greens. So good.

82. Cut pancetta into matchsticks and crisp in a skillet with some oil, then caramelize onions in the fat. Toss both with chopped bitter greens  radicchio, escarole or endive, for example  toasted pine nuts and halved cherry or grape tomatoes.

83. Toss thinly sliced Vidalia or other sweet onions with olive oil and red wine vinegar. Sear a skirt steak and let sit a minute; slice it thin. Toss salad greens with the onions, roasted red peppers, and steak; add a little more oil and vinegar if necessary.

SALADS WITH NOODLES

84. Spring rolls, unrolled: One at a time, soften a few sheets of rice paper in warm water. Drain, pat dry, cut into strips and toss with chopped cucumber, grated carrots, chopped cilantro, bean sprouts, chili flakes and chopped roasted peanuts. Dress with toasted sesame oil, fish sauce or soy sauce, and rice vinegar or lime juice. A few shrimp are a nice addition.

85. Mix lots of arugula with somewhat less cold whole wheat penne, lemon zest, olive oil and Parmesan. The idea is an arugula salad with pasta, not a pasta salad with arugula.

86. Toss chilled cooked soba noodles with diced cucumber (if theyre fat and old, peel and seed them first), a small amount of hijiki reconstituted with water, toasted sesame seeds and a vinaigrette laced with soy sauce and miso.

87. Cold not-sesame noodles: Combine about a half-cup peanut butter with a tablespoon soy sauce and enough coconut milk to make the mixture creamy (about a half cup), along with garlic and chili flakes in a blender or food processor. Toss sauce with cooked and cooled noodles, a load of mint, Thai basil, and/or cilantro, and lime juice. Shredded cucumber and carrots optional.

88. Toss cooked pasta with roasted red peppers, toasted walnuts, fresh goat cheese, basil and olive oil. Corny, but still good.

89. Soak or cook rice noodles, drain and rinse; toss with cubed unripe mango, chopped peanuts, shredded carrot and minced scallion. Make a dressing of rice vinegar, fish sauce, lime juice, chili and a bit of sugar.

90. Sort of classic pasta salad: Pasta, artichoke hearts, sliced prosciutto or salami, chopped plum tomato. Dress with olive oil and a bit of balsamic vinegar, perhaps with some mustard.

GRAIN SALADS

91. Cereal for grown-ups: Start with puffed brown rice; toss with chopped tomatoes, scallions, a minced chili, cooked or canned chickpeas and toasted unsweetened coconut. Dress with coconut milk and lime juice.

92. Simmer a cup of bulgur and some roughly chopped cauliflower florets until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Toss with chopped tarragon, roughly chopped hazelnuts, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, olive oil and lemon juice.

93. Mix leftover rice with lemon or lime juice, soy sauce and a combination of sesame and peanut oils. Microwave if necessary to soften the rice, then serve at room temperature, tossed with sprouts, shredded radishes, chopped scallions, bits of cooked meat or fish if you like and more soy sauce.

94. Cook and cool quinoa. Toss with olive oil, loads of lemon juice, tons of parsley, some chopped tomatoes and, if you like, toasted pine nuts. Call it quinoa tabbouleh.

95. Mix cooked couscous or quinoa with orange zest and juice, olive oil, maybe honey, sliced oranges, raisins or dried cranberries, chopped red onion and chopped almonds. Serve over greens, or not.

96. Cook short-grain white rice in watered-down coconut milk (be careful that it doesnt burn) and a few cardamom pods. While warm, toss with peas (they can be raw if theyre fresh and tender), chopped cashews or pistachios, a pinch of chili flakes and chopped raw spinach.

97. Toss cooked, cooled farro, wheat berries, barley or other chewy grain with chopped-up grapes. Add olive oil, lemon juice and thinly sliced romaine lettuce; toss again, with ricotta salata or feta if you want.

98. Toss cooked bulgur with cooked chickpeas, quartered cherry or grape tomatoes, a little cumin, lots of chopped parsley, and lemon juice.

99. Toss cooked quinoa with fresh sliced apricots, cherries, pecans, and enough lemon and black pepper to make the whole thing savory.

100. Mash a canned chipotle with some of its adobo and stir with olive oil and lime juice. Toss with drained canned hominy, fresh corn cut from the cob (or drained pinto beans), cilantro and green onions.

101. Cook a pot of short-grain rice. While its still hot, toss with raw grated zucchini, fermented black beans, sriracha, sesame oil, sake and a touch of rice vinegar. Add bits of leftover roast chicken or pork if you have it, and pass soy sauce at the table.$$,1,@cat6,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2009-07-22', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Four pounds of frozen sliced peaches can be substituted for fresh; there is no need to defrost them. Start step 2 when the peaches are almost done.

Serves 6 to 8

Filling
4 	tablespoons unsalted butter 
5 	pounds peaches , peeled, pitted and cut into 1/2-inch wedges
6 	tablespoons sugar 
1/8 	teaspoon salt 
1 	tablespoon lemon juice 
1 1/2 	teaspoons cornstarch 

Topping
1 1/2 	cups all-purpose flour , plus extra for work surface
6 	tablespoons sugar 
1 1/2 	teaspoons baking powder 
1/4 	teaspoon baking soda 
1/4 	teaspoons salt 
3/4 	cup buttermilk 
4 	tablespoons unsalted butter , melted and cooled
1 	teaspoon ground cinnamon 


1. For the filling: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Melt butter in large oven-safe nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add two-thirds of peaches, sugar, and salt and cook, covered, until peaches release their juices, about 5 minutes. Remove lid and simmer until all liquid has evaporated and peaches begin to caramelize, 15 to 20 minutes. Add remaining peaches and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Whisk lemon juice and cornstarch in small bowl, then stir into peach mixture. Cover skillet and set aside off heat.

2. For the topping: Meanwhile, whisk flour, 5 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. Stir in buttermilk and butter until dough forms. Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface and knead briefly until smooth, about 30 seconds.

3/4 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup pecans
4 (1 1/4-inch thick) pork chops
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
Extra-virgin olive oil
2 green apples, cored
1/4 cup finely chopped candied ginger.

1. Preheat a broiler or light a charcoal grill.

2. In a small nonreactive bowl, whisk together the syrup, vinegar, sugar and cinnamon.

3. Place a small pan over medium heat, add the pecans and about 2 tablespoons of the maple-syrup sauce and cook for a few minutes, until the nuts are glazed and fragrant. Transfer the nuts to a plate and spread them out to cool. Transfer the cooled nuts to a cutting board, chop roughly and set aside.

4. Season the pork chops aggressively with salt and pepper, then drizzle with olive oil. When the broiler is hot, or the coals are covered with gray ash and you can hold your hand 5 inches above them for only 1 to 2 seconds, broil or grill the meat for approximately 7 minutes per side. Brush with some of the remaining maple glaze every 2 or 3 minutes, turning them frequently to prevent the sugar from burning.

5. When the chops are cooked, remove from the broiler or grill and let them rest for 5 minutes before serving. Meanwhile, slice the cored apples into thick rounds, drizzle with olive oil, season lightly with salt and pepper and place on the broiler pan or grill until tender when pierced with a fork. These, too, should be brushed with the maple glaze and turned frequently.

6. Serve chops with the apple slices, sprinkled with pecans and candied ginger.

Adapted from Matthew Kenney.

6 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade, plus more as needed
2 cups polenta
6 ounces soft goat cheese, crumbled
1 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary
2 tablespoons butter

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.

1. Bring the stock to a boil in a large, heavy saucepan over high heat. Whisk in the polenta in a steady stream, then decrease the heat to medium. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, more constantly than you would think possible, until the polenta begins to thicken, approximately 10 minutes. (Keep stirring; otherwise the polenta will boil up and may splatter on your hand.)

2. Add the cheese and rosemary and stir for approximately 2 minutes. Stir in the butter, season with salt and pepper to taste and serve. It keeps well on the stove, though it thickens as it rests. If cooking before the chops are done, which is a smart idea, either remove from the heat at a thinner consistency or add a little more stock later.

Serves 4
Because the bulbous end of butternut squash contains the seeds and stringy fibers, purchase squash with a relatively long neckthey have more usable flesh. You can replace the chicken broth with vegetable broth for a vegetarian version of this soup.
1	medium butternut squash  (about 3 pounds), peeled, seeded, and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks (see related Step by Step)
3	medium shallots , peeled and quartered
1/4	cup vegetable oil 
Salt  and pepper
4	cups low-sodium chicken broth  (see note)
1	tablespoon honey 
1	teaspoon lime juice 
1/2	teaspoon ground cumin 
1/4	cup heavy cream 
2	tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves 
1	tablespoon minced chipotle chiles in adobo sauce 
Sour cream  (optional)
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Toss squash, shallots, oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper in large bowl, then arrange in single layer in large roasting pan. Roast, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are golden brown and softened, about 45 minutes. Add ½ cup broth to pan and scrape up any browned bits with wooden spoon. Return to oven and cook until liquid has reduced and vegetables are glazed, about 5 minutes.
2. Working in 2 batches, puree squash mixture and remaining broth in blender until smooth. Transfer pureed squash mixture to large saucepan and stir in honey, lime juice, cumin, and cream. Bring soup to simmer over medium-low heat, adding ¼ cup water at a time as necessary to adjust consistency. Just prior to serving, stir in cilantro and chiles. Serve with dollop of sour cream, if desired. (Soup can be refrigerated in airtight container for 3 days.)

1	cup white sugar
2	teaspoons brown sugar
2	cups white-wine vinegar
1	cup dry red wine
2	tablespoons canola oil
2	tablespoons unsalted butter
4	pounds beef bottom-round roast
5	cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
1	large Spanish onion, peeled and thinly sliced
2	stalks celery, chopped
2	leeks, white and light-green parts only, washed well and thinly sliced
2 bay leaves
1&#8260;3	cup Worcestershire sauce
1	tablespoon soy sauce
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1	green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and thinly sliced
1	red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and thinly sliced
2	tablespoons cilantro, well washed and roughly chopped, for garnish.

1.	Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Combine the white sugar and 1 cup of water in a heavy saucepan and cook, without stirring, over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves and turns dark caramel, 8 to 10 minutes. Carefully add the brown sugar, vinegar and wine, and cook, stirring, until all the caramel has melted. Set aside.

2.	Heat a Dutch oven large enough to hold the meat over medium-high heat. When hot, add the canola oil and butter. When these begin to shimmer and foam, sear the roast on all sides. Transfer the meat to a platter and set aside.

3.	Add the garlic, onion, celery, leeks and bay leaves to the Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat until they have softened and almost begun to brown. Add the Worcestershire and soy sauces and stir to incorporate, then return the meat to the pot and season with salt and pepper. Cover with the bell-pepper slices and pour the caramel sauce over the top. Cover, place in the oven and cook for approximately 2½ hours  basting and turning the meat every 45 minutes  until it is very tender.

4.	Remove the meat and allow it to stand on a platter, tented in foil, for at least 30 minutes. If the sauce is not syrupy and thick, remove the vegetables (discard the bay leaves) and arrange them around the meat, then place the Dutch oven, uncovered, over medium-high heat and allow the sauce to reduce.

5.	When the sauce is ready, slice the meat and return it, along with the vegetables, to the sauce and reheat in the oven or, covered, on the stove. Check the seasoning and garnish with chopped cilantro.

Serves 6 to 8.

2 butternut squashes, quartered, seeds removed
2 to 3 Granny Smith apples
1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 cups apple cider or juice
2 cups chicken broth or water, more as needed
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch nutmeg, or to taste
Juice of 1 lemon, or to taste
Dried cranberries or dried cherries, toasted almond slivers and diced apples, for garnish, optional.

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut each squash quarter in half and place in a large bowl. Quarter and core apples, and add to bowl. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons oil and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Rub everything to coat well, and transfer to a large baking sheet. Cover tightly with foil.

2. Bake until apples are soft in center, about 30 minutes. Transfer apples to a plate to cool, and return squash to oven to bake until soft, another 15 to 30 minutes. When apples and squash are cool enough to handle, scoop out flesh into a large bowl; discard skins. Working in batches, purée squash and apples in a food processor or blender. If necessary, add some apple cider to each batch to help purée.

3. Transfer purée to a 4- to 6-quart soup pot. Add remaining cider and enough chicken broth or water for desired consistency. Place over medium-low heat. Add cinnamon, nutmeg and lemon juice; as soup warms, flavors will emerge. Heat just until steaming, and adjust seasonings to taste. Ladle into warm bowls. If desired, garnish with dried cranberries or dried cherries, toasted almond slivers and diced apple.

About 2 quarts corn or canola oil, for frying
3 eggs
2/3 cup cornstarch
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 large or 2 small heads cauliflower, trimmed and cut into florets
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 cup ketchup
Cayenne pepper, to taste
Cooked white rice, for serving (optional)
Steamed greens, for serving (optional).

1. Put at least 2 inches of oil into a deep-sided, heavy-bottomed pot and bring to 350 degrees on a candy thermometer. (In a bind, put a pinch of flour into the pot; at 350 it will sizzle but wont burn.)

2. In a bowl large enough to accommodate the cauliflower, whisk together the eggs and cornstarch. Season with a large pinch of salt and pepper and add the cauliflower. Toss to coat the florets evenly.

3. Fry the cauliflower in batches, so as not to crowd the pan, making sure that the oil is hot each time you add fresh florets. Cook until the cauliflower begins to mottle, about 4 minutes, then transfer to paper towels to drain.

4. Now take a tablespoon of the hot oil from the frying pot and place it in a large pan over medium heat, swirling to coat the pan. Add the garlic and fry until fragrant, then add the ketchup, stirring occasionally, until it begins to bubble and caramelize around the edges. Add cayenne pinch by pinch to taste and then the cauliflower. Toss until hot and coated. Serve with white rice and steamed greens, if desired.

Serves 4 to 6.   Published May 1, 2004.  

If you prefer not to make the sauce base, mix 1/2 cup glace de viande with 3/4 cup water and 1/4 cup red wine and use this mixture in place of the base in step 4. For this recipe, use a traditional skillet. The steaks leave behind more fond (browned bits) than they do in a nonstick skillet, and more fond means a richer, more flavorful sauce. A superb embellishment for Steak Diane is a drizzle of white truffle oil just before serving. If you do not wish to flambé, simmer the cognac in step 2 for 10 to 15 seconds for a slightly less sweet flavor profile.

1/4	cup Cognac
2	teaspoons Dijon mustard
2	tablespoons unsalted butter (cold)
1	teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2	tablespoons minced fresh chives

INSTRUCTIONS
1. For the Sauce Base: Heat oil and tomato paste in Dutch oven over medium-high heat; cook, stirring constantly, until paste begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add onions, carrot, and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until mixture is reddish brown, about 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons water and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is well browned, about 3 minutes, adding remaining water when needed to prevent scorching. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add wine and, using a heatproof rubber spatula, scrape up browned bits on bottom and sides of pot; bring to boil, stirring occasionally (mixture will thicken slightly). Add beef and chicken broths, peppercorns, thyme, and bay; bring to boil and cook, uncovered, occasionally scraping bottom and sides of pot with spatula, until reduced to 2 1/2 cups, 35 to 40 minutes.

2. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; you should have about 1 1/4 cups.

3. For the steaks: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat until smoking. Meanwhile, season steaks with salt and pepper. Place 2 steaks in skillet and cook until well browned, about 1 1/2 minutes. Following illustrations below, flip steaks and weight with heavy-bottomed pan; continue to cook until well browned on second side, about 1 1/2 minutes longer. Transfer steaks to large platter and tent with foil. Add 1 tablespoon oil to now-empty skillet and repeat with remaining steaks; transfer second batch of steaks to platter.

4. For the sauce: Off heat, add 1 tablespoon oil and shallots to now-empty skillet; using skillet's residual heat, cook, stirring frequently, until shallots are slightly softened and browned, about 45 seconds. Add cognac; let stand until cognac warms slightly, about 10 seconds, then set skillet over high heat. Using chimney match, ignite cognac; shake skillet until flames subside, then simmer cognac until reduced to about 1 tablespoon, about 10 seconds. Add sauce base and mustard; simmer until slightly thickened and reduced to 1 cup, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in butter; off heat, add Worcestershire sauce, any accumulated juices from steaks, and 1 tablespoon chives. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

5. Set steaks on individual dinner plates, spoon 2 tablespoons sauce over each steak, sprinkle with chives, and serve immediately, passing remaining sauce separately.$$,1,@cat4,@subcat1,PARSEDATETIME('2009-12-25', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

By MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN

Black-eyed peas may not be part of the Greek New Years tradition, as they are in the American South, but this recipe still makes a great, light dish.

1 1/2 cups black-eyed peas, washed and picked over
1 bay leaf
Salt to taste
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 red pepper, diced
2 plump garlic cloves, green shoots removed, minced
1 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly crushed in a mortar
1 red onion, halved and sliced (optional)
Freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1/2 cup crumbled feta

1. Place the beans in a pot with the bay leaf and cover with water by 2 to 3 inches. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, add salt to taste and simmer gently until peas are tender but not mushy, about 45 to 50 minutes. Drain through a colander set over a bowl. Transfer the black-eyed peas to a salad bowl.

2. Meanwhile, heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat, and add 1 tablespoon of the oil. When it is hot, add the red pepper and cook, stirring often, until just crisp-tender, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cumin seeds, and stir together for another minute or two until the garlic is fragrant. Remove from the heat and toss with the black-eyed peas. Toss with the vinegar, remaining olive oil, 1/4 cup of the bean broth, and salt and pepper to taste. Cool to room temperature.

3. If using the red onion, place it in a bowl, cover with cold water, and soak for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse. Add to the salad along with the dill and parsley. Toss well. Sprinkle the feta over the top, and serve.

Yield: Serves four to six.

Advance preparation: You can make the dish through step 2 up to three days before you wish to serve. Keep well covered in the refrigerator. Proceed with step 3 shortly before serving.$$,1,@cat6,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2009-12-30', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Time: About two hours, plus overnight soaking

1 1/2 pounds black-eyed peas, or about 4 cups
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 medium ham hocks, or 1 ham hock and 1/4 pound country ham trimmings (also called seasoning meat)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
4 medium garlic cloves, crushed
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
3 cups steamed white rice
Prepared vinegar peppers, to taste (optional).

1. In a large bowl, cover peas generously with water, add baking soda and soak overnight.

2. The next day, rinse ham hocks and pat dry. Heat oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot. Sear ham hocks and ham trimmings, turning so all sides are cooked.

3. Remove seasoning meat, if using. Add water to ham hocks just to cover, bring to a boil and then turn heat to a strong simmer. Partly cover pot and cook hocks until slightly tender, about 45 minutes.

4. If using seasoning meat, return it to pot. Add peas, onion, celery, green pepper, garlic, bay leaves, salt and red pepper, along with five cups of water. Bring to a boil, then turn to a simmer and cook until beans are tender and water begins to look saucy, 30 to 45 minutes. Serve over white rice with vinegar peppers, if desired.

1 tri-tip steak, about 2 to 2 1/2 pounds, or other 2-inch-thick steak

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 cup cherry tomatoes

2 tablespoons almonds, shelled

3 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed

1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and chopped, optional

1 to 2 tablespoons sherry or red wine vinegar, or to taste

1/3 cup olive oil

1/2 teaspoon pimentón or other chili powder, optional.

1. Heat oven to 500 degrees. Generously season both sides of steak with salt and pepper. Put a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. When it is very hot, add steak to one side of pan and tomatoes, almonds, garlic cloves and jalapeños, if you are using them, to the other. Sear steak for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring tomato mixture once or twice.

2. Once a nice crust has formed on one side of steak, turn it over, carefully transfer the now-charred tomato mixture to a food processor, and put pan in oven. (If tomatoes are not a bit blackened, leave them in pan and check again after a minute or two in oven.) Cook until steak is rare to medium-rare, about 6 to 12 minutes longer depending on its thickness (an instant-read thermometer will register 125 degrees when steak is medium-rare). Transfer steak to a plate and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes.

3. While steak is cooking or resting, add vinegar and olive oil to tomato mixture in food processor, and season with salt, pepper and pimentón or chili powder if using. Process, adding more olive oil or vinegar as you like, until mixture reaches desired consistency. Sauce should still be a little crunchy from almonds.

4. Slice steak thinly, against grain. Serve with sauce.

By MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN

Shrimp shells are used here to make a subtle shellfish broth for the risotto. Make sure you dont overcook the shrimp; they will take only four to five minutes to cook, and the contrast of their succulent texture against the chewy rice will be lost if the shrimp become rubbery.

1 pound medium shrimp, in the shell
1 quart chicken stock or water
Salt to taste
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1 1/2 cups arborio or carnaroli rice
2 large garlic cloves, green shoots removed, minced
1/2 cup dry white wine
A generous pinch of saffron (optional)
1 cup thawed frozen peas, or fresh peas steamed for five minutes
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
Freshly ground pepper to taste

1. Shell the shrimp and de-vein if necessary. Salt them lightly, and set aside in a bowl (in the refrigerator, if you wont be making and serving the risotto right away). Rinse the shells, and combine them with 5 cups of water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, skim off foam, reduce the heat to low and simmer partly covered for 30 minutes. Strain and add to the chicken stock or water. Taste, add enough salt to make a well seasoned broth and bring to a simmer in a saucepan.

2. Heat the oil over medium heat in a large nonstick frying pan or a large, wide saucepan. Add the onion. Cook, stirring, until the onion softens, three to five minutes, and then add the rice and the garlic. Cook, stirring, until the grains of rice are separate and beginning to crackle.

3. Stir in the wine, and cook over medium heat, stirring. The wine should bubble, but not too quickly. You want some of the flavor to cook into the rice before it evaporates. When the wine has just about evaporated, stir in a ladleful or two of the simmering stock, enough to just cover the rice. The stock should bubble slowly. Cook, stirring often, until it is almost absorbed. Add another couple of ladles of the stock. Crush the saffron threads between your fingers and stir in. Continue to cook, stirring often  not too fast and not too slowly, adding more stock when the rice is almost dry  for 20 minutes.

4. Taste a bit of the rice. It should taste chewy but not hard in the middle. Continue adding simmering stock and stirring until the rice reaches this al dente stage. Stir in more stock to cover, and add the peas and the shrimp. Cook, stirring, for another four to five minutes, until the shrimp are pink and cooked through but still moist and the peas are bright. Stir in the parsley and another small ladle of stock, remove from the heat, add pepper, stir for a few seconds and serve.

Yield: Serves 4.

Advance preparation: The broth can be made several hours before you wish to cook the risotto. You can make the risotto halfway through step 3 several hours ahead. Spread out in the pan in a thin layer, and allow to cool. Shortly before serving, add a ladleful of stock to the rice, bring back to a simmer and proceed with the recipe.$$,1,@cat4,@subcat6,PARSEDATETIME('2010-01-27', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

By MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN
These zucchini fritters are based on a recipe I learned from the cookbook author Diane Kochilas. A classic mezze served in Greek taverna, theyre like a Greek version of latkes.

2 pounds large zucchini, trimmed and grated on the wide holes of a grater or food processor
Salt
2 eggs
1/2 cup chopped mixed fresh herbs, such as fennel, dill, mint, parsley (I like to use mostly dill)
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 cup fresh or dry breadcrumbs, more as necessary
Freshly ground pepper
1 cup crumbled feta
All-purpose flour as needed and for dredging
Olive oil for frying

1. Salt the zucchini generously and leave to drain in a colander for one hour, tossing and squeezing the zucchini from time to time. Take up handfuls of zucchini, and squeeze out all of the moisture. Alternately, wrap in a clean dish towel, and squeeze out the water by twisting at both ends.

2. In a large bowl, beat the eggs and add the shredded zucchini, herbs, cumin, bread crumbs, salt and pepper to taste and feta. Mix together well. Take up a small handful of the mixture; if it presses neatly into a patty, it is the right consistency. If it seems wet, add more breadcrumbs or a few tablespoons of all-purpose flour. When the mixture has the right consistency, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour or longer.

3. Heat 1 inch of olive oil in a large frying pan until rippling, or at about 275 degrees. Meanwhile, take up heaped tablespoons of the zucchini mixture, and form balls or patties. Lightly dredge in flour.

4. When the oil is very hot, add the patties in batches to the pan. Fry until golden brown, turning once with a spider or slotted spoon. Remove from the oil, and drain briefly on a rack. Serve with plain Greek style yogurt if desired.

Yield: Serves six to eight.

Advance preparation: The mixture can be assembled up to a day before you make and fry the fritters.$$,1,@cat10,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2010-02-17', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

For the beans:
1 pound dried large lima beans
1 large white onion, cut in half
4 garlic cloves, crushed
1 bay leaf
Salt to taste
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1/2 cup finely chopped yellow or red bell pepper
1/2 cup finely chopped red onion, soaked for five minutes in cold water, drained and rinsed (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill

For the beets:
8 small beets, greens cut away, scrubbed
1/3 cup red wine vinegar or sherry vinegar
Salt to taste
2 garlic cloves, cut in half
1/2 teaspoon sugar

1. Place the beans in a large pot. Cover by 2 inches with water, and bring to a gentle boil. Skim off any foam, and add the onion, garlic and bay leaf. Turn the heat to low, cover and simmer 30 minutes. Add salt to taste, and simmer an additional 20 minutes until just tender. Remove from the heat. Remove and discard the onion, garlic cloves and the bay leaf. Allow the beans to cool in the liquid, then drain through a strainer set over a bowl. Gently toss the beans in a bowl with the lemon juice, olive oil, celery, peppers, onion and herbs. If desired, add 2 to 4 tablespoons of the bean broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.

2. Cook the beets while the beans are cooking. Place in a saucepan, cover with water, add 1/4 cup of the vinegar and salt to taste. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 30 to 45 minutes, depending on the size of the beets. Remove from the heat, add the garlic to the pot and set aside to cool. Remove the beets from the pot (do not drain), slip off the skins and cut in wedges.

3. Combine the remaining vinegar, the sugar and 1/4 cup of the beet broth (discard the garlic). Toss with the beets. Arrange the beans on a plate or in a bowl and surround with the beets. If you wish, serve this dish with skordalia.

2. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium heat in a large, heavy skillet. Add the leek and cook, stirring, until tender, about three minutes. Add the garlic, stir together until fragrant, about 30 seconds, and add the squash. Cook, stirring, until tender, 10 to 12 minutes for winter squash, about eight minutes for zucchini. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the dill and the mint. Remove from the heat.

3. Place the remaining tablespoon of oil in a 2-quart casserole or in a 9-inch cast iron skillet, brush the sides of the pan with the oil and place in the oven. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs in a large bowl. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Whisk in the yogurt and the Parmesan. Stir in the squash or zucchini mixture.

4. Remove the baking dish from the oven and scrape in the egg mixture. Place in the oven, and bake 30 minutes or until puffed and lightly colored. Allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before serving. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.

Yield: Serves six to eight.

Advance preparation: The squash can be prepared through step 2 as far as a day ahead.$$,1,@cat5,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2010-03-02', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

1 1/2	green peppers, stemmed and seeded
10	garlic cloves
1	pound dried black beans, rinsed and picked over to remove any stones
1	smoked ham hock
2	bay leaves
5	teaspoons salt, or to taste
1/4	cup olive oil
4	slices thick bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1	Spanish onion, diced
1	jalapeño, stemmed and finely chopped
1	teaspoon dried oregano
1/2	teaspoon ground cumin
1/2	teaspoon freshly ground
black pepper
3	tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1	tablespoon turbinado or other brown sugar.

1.	Cut 1 green pepper into 1-inch squares. Smash and peel 4 of the garlic cloves. Put the green pepper and garlic into a large pot with the beans, ham hock, bay leaves and 1 tablespoon salt. Add 2 quarts water and bring to a boil. Cover the pot and simmer until the beans are tender, an hour or more.

2.	Meanwhile, make a sofrito. Cut the remaining ½ green pepper into ¼-inch dice. Peel and finely chop the remaining garlic. Heat the olive oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the green pepper and onion and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, jalapeño (leave out the seeds if you dont want it too spicy), oregano, cumin, black pepper and 2 teaspoons salt and stir for another minute. Pour in the vinegar and scrape any browned bits from bottom of pan with a wooden spoon. This is your sofrito.

3.	When the beans are cooked, discard the bay leaf. Remove and set aside the ham hock and let it cool. Transfer 1 cup of beans to small bowl, mash them into a paste with the back of a fork and return to the pot. Add the sofrito, then the sugar. Pull the meat from the ham hock, leaving behind any white sinew or gristle. Chop the ham into ½-inch pieces and return it to the bean pot.

4.	Stir the beans well and bring to a boil over medium heat, then lower to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes or so, skimming any foam from the top. Taste for salt and serve with white rice. Serves 8 to 10. Adapted from Tastes Like Cuba, by Eduardo Machado and Michael Domitrovich.$$,1,@cat8,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2010-03-04', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

3 tablespoons olive oil
1 leek, well washed and chopped
Salt and black pepper
2 cups quartered button mushrooms
1 1/2cups chicken stock
1 sprig fresh rosemary
2 medium carrots, cut into coins
2 boneless chicken thighs, diced
1 cup peas, frozen or fresh
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into bits
1/2 cup buttermilk or soured milk (see note)
1 egg.


1. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Put oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When oil is hot, add the leeks, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until liquid has released and evaporated, about 8 to 10 minutes.

2. Add stock and rosemary; bring to a boil, and let bubble for a minute or two, then add carrots and chicken and reduce heat so the liquid simmers. Cook until carrots are almost tender and chicken is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Add peas and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are brightly colored and just tender, another minute or so; fish out rosemary stem and discard.

3. Whisk cornstarch with a few tablespoons of broth to make a slurry. Add slurry to pot and stir until liquid thickens slightly. Transfer everything to an ovenproof dish and set aside.

4. Put flour in a food processor with baking powder, soda and salt. Add butter and process until mixture resembles small peas, no more than 30 seconds. (You can also do this by hand, using two knives, a fork, your fingers, or a pastry cutter). Transfer mixture to a bowl and mix in buttermilk and egg until it just comes together; it should be sticky.

5. Drop spoonfuls of batter on top of vegetables and chicken and smooth with a knife, covering as much surface area as possible but leaving a few gaps for steam to escape. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes until golden on top and bubbly underneath. Scoop into bowls and serve immediately.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings

Note: If you dont have buttermilk, gently warm milk until its about 100 degrees; stir in a couple of teaspoons of vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes.

Serves 4.  

If you like, use thinly sliced cutlets available at many supermarkets. These cutlets don't have any tenderloins and can be used as they are.

INGREDIENTS
2	 large lemons
4	boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds), preferably kosher or Bell and Evans, rinsed, dried thoroughly, trimmed of excess fat, and prepared according to illustrations below
1/2	cup unbleached all-purpose flour
4	tablespoons vegetable oil
1	 small shallot , minced (about 2 tablespoons) or 1 small garlic clove, minced (about 1 teaspoon)
1	cup chicken stock or canned low-sodium chicken broth
2	tablespoons small capers , drained
3	tablespoons unsalted butter , softened
2	tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, set large heatproof plate on rack, and heat oven to 200 degrees.

2. Halve one lemon pole to pole. Trim ends from one half and cut crosswise into slices 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick; set aside. Juice remaining half and whole lemon to obtain 1/4 cup juice; reserve.

3. Sprinkle both sides of cutlets generously with salt and pepper. Measure flour into pie tin or shallow baking dish. Working one cutlet at a time, coat with flour, and shake to remove excess.

4. Heat heavy-bottomed 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until hot, about 2 minutes; add 2 tablespoons oil and swirl pan to coat. Lay half of chicken pieces in skillet. Sauté cutlets, without moving them, until lightly browned on first side, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Turn cutlets and cook until second side is lightly browned, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes longer. Remove pan from heat and transfer cutlets to plate in oven. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to now-empty skillet and heat until shimmering. Add remaining chicken pieces and repeat.

5. Add shallot or garlic to now-empty skillet and return skillet to medium heat. Sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds for shallot or 10 seconds for garlic. Add stock and lemon slices, increase heat to high, and scrape skillet bottom with wooden spoon or spatula to loosen browned bits. Simmer until liquid reduces to about 1/3 cup, about 4 minutes. Add lemon juice and capers and simmer until sauce reduces again to 1/3 cup, about 1 minute. Remove pan from heat and swirl in butter until butter melts and thickens sauce; swirl in parsley.

1. Peel the potatoes and place them in a large pot of cold water. Set over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium high and cook until you can poke a bamboo skewer through a potato, 40 to 50 minutes, being careful not to overcook. Drain and set aside to cool and dry completely, preferably overnight in the refrigerator.

2. Meanwhile, clarify the butter by melting it in a small saucepan over medium heat. When foam forms, use a spoon to remove and discard it. Cook, skimming, until the butter stops bubbling. Take care not to brown it. Strain through a fine sieve or cheesecloth and reserve. You should have about 5 tablespoons.

3. Heat a cast-iron or heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Grate the potatoes on the large side of a box grater into a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper and mix lightly. Add 3 tablespoons butter to pan, swirl until it begins to melt and add the shredded potatoes. Cook until golden brown and crusted on the bottom, almost (but not quite) burned in parts, about 15 minutes.

4. Use a wide spatula to flip the potatoes, or quickly invert the pan onto a dinner plate and gently slide them back into the pan.

4/2009

Avoid using nonstick or aluminum roasting pans in this recipe. The former can cause the chicken to brown too quickly, while the latter may react with the lemon juice, producing off-flavors. 

Serves 3 to 4
1	whole chicken (3 1/2- to 4-pounds), backbone removed and butterflied
3	tablespoons grated lemon zest plus 1/3 cup juice from 3 lemons
1	teaspoon sugar 
Salt and pepper 
2	cups low-sodium chicken broth 
1	cup plus 1 tablespoon water 
1	teaspoon cornstarch 
3	tablespoons unsalted butter 
1	tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley 


1. SEASON Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Combine lemon zest, sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt in small bowl. Rub 2 tablespoons zest mixture under skin of chicken. Season chicken with salt and pepper and transfer to roasting pan. (Seasoned chicken can be refrigerated for 2 hours)

2. ROAST Whisk broth, 1 cup water, lemon juice, and remaining zest mixture in 4-cup liquid measuring cup, then pour into roasting pan. (Liquid should just reach skin of thighs. If it does not, add enough water to reach skin of thighs.) Roast until skin is golden brown and thigh meat registers 170 to 175 degrees, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to cutting board and let rest 20 minutes. 

3. MAKE SAUCE Pour liquid from pan, along with any accumulated chicken juices, into saucepan (you should have about 1 1/2 cups). Skim fat, then cook over medium-high until reduced to 1 cup, about 5 minutes. Whisk cornstarch with remaining water in small bowl until no lumps remain, then whisk into saucepan. Simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Off heat, whisk in butter and parley and season with salt and pepper. Carve chicken and serve, passing sauce at table.

Adapted from Fiesta at Ricks by Rick Bayless with Deann Green Bayless (W. W. Norton, 2010)

Time: 25 minutes plus 30 minutes refrigeration

1/2 head of garlic, cloves separated
2 to 3 fresh serrano chilies
1 cup packed cilantro leaves
1 cup packed parsley leaves
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
1 1/2 pounds sashimi-quality skinless, boneless fish fillets, such as Alaskan halibut, ahi tuna, or farmed yellowtail, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 baby cucumbers (about 7 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch cubes
Tender lettuce leaves (such as butter lettuce), for garnish
2 large ripe avocados, pitted, flesh scooped out and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
1. Place a dry nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Roast unpeeled garlic cloves and chilies, turning frequently, until soft, about 10 minutes for the chilies and 15 minutes for the garlic. Cool, then remove skins from garlic and stems from chilies.

2. In a food processor, combine chilies, garlic, cilantro, parsley, olive oil and salt. Process until nearly smooth. Cover the herb paste and refrigerate until needed.

3. To finish ceviche: In a large bowl, whisk together the lime juice and 1/2 cup of herb paste. Add fish and cucumber, and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes (or up to an hour). Transfer remaining herb paste to a jar, cover with a film of oil, refrigerate and save for another use, like stirring into eggs or smearing on chicken before roasting or grilling.

4. Taste and season with additional lime juice or salt as desired. Gently fold in most of the avocado, reserving a few cubes as a garnish. Line plates or cocktail glasses with lettuce leaves, and top with ceviche and remaining avocado.

4/2005

The dough should be sticky, but if you find that it's too wet and not coming together in the mixer, add 2 tablespoons more flour and mix until the dough forms a cohesive mass. Make sure to use light brown sugar in the sugar mix; dark brown sugar has a stronger molasses flavor that can be overwhelming. After baking, don't let the bread cool in the pan for more than 5 minutes or it will stick to the pan and come out in pieces. Monkey Bread is at its best when served warm.

Serves 6 to 8

For the Dough
2	tablespoons unsalted butter , softened, plus 2 tablespoons melted
1	cup warm milk (about 110 degrees)
1/3	cup warm water (about 110 degrees)
1/4	cup granulated sugar 
1	package rapid-rise yeast or instant yeast
3 1/4	cups all-purpose flour , plus extra for work surface
2	teaspoons table salt 

For the Brown Sugar Coating
1	cup packed light brown sugar 
2	teaspoons ground cinnamon 
8	tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick), melted

For the Glaze
1	cup confectioners' sugar 
2	tablespoons milk 


For the Dough:

1. Adjust oven rack to medium-low position and heat oven to 200 degrees. When oven reaches 200 degrees, turn it off. Butter Bundt pan with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Set aside.

2. In large measuring cup, mix together milk, water, melted butter, sugar, and yeast. Mix flour and salt in standing mixer fitted with dough hook, (see below for making Monkey Bread without a mixer). Turn machine to low and slowly add milk mixture. After dough comes together, increase speed to medium and mix until dough is shiny and smooth, 6 to 7 minutes. Turn dough onto lightly floured counter and knead briefly to form smooth, round ball. Coat large bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Place dough in bowl and coat surface of dough with cooking spray. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in warm oven until dough doubles in size, 50 to 60 minutes. 

For the Sugar Coating:

3. While dough is rising, mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in bowl. Place melted butter in second bowl. Set aside.

To Form the Bread:

4. Gently remove dough from bowl, and pat into rough 8-inch square. Using bench scraper or knife, cut dough into 64 pieces. (See photos 1 and 2 on page 9.)

5. Following photo 3 on page 9, roll each dough piece into a ball. Working one at a time, dip balls in melted butter, allowing excess butter to drip back into bowl. Roll in brown sugar mixture, then, following photo 4 on page 9, layer balls in Bundt pan, staggering seams where dough balls meet as you build layers.

6. Cover Bundt pan tightly with plastic wrap and place in turned-off oven until dough balls are puffy and have risen 1 to 2 inches from top of pan, 50 to 70 minutes. 

7. Remove pan from oven and heat oven to 350 degrees. Unwrap pan and bake until top is deep brown and caramel begins to bubble around edges, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in pan for 5 minutes, then turn out on platter and allow to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. 

For the glaze:

8. While bread cools, whisk confectioners' sugar and milk in small bowl until lumps are gone. Using whisk, drizzle glaze over warm monkey bread, letting it run over top and sides of bread. Serve warm.

2	tablespoons water
4	boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6 to 8 ounces each), trimmed of excess fat
Vegetable oil for grill rack
Large disposable aluminum baking pan

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Whisk together mustard, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 3 tablespoons olive oil, parsley, 1/4 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in small bowl; set aside.

2. Whisk together remaining tablespoon lemon juice, remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, remaining teaspoon sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, garlic, and water in medium bowl. Place marinade and chicken in gallon-size zipper-lock bag and toss to coat; press out as much air as possible and seal bag. Refrigerate 30 minutes, flipping bag after 15 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, light large chimney starter filled with charcoal (6 quarts, or about 100 briquettes) and allow to burn until coals are fully ignited and partially covered with thin layer of ash, about 20 minutes. Build modified two-level fire by arranging all coals over half of grill, leaving other half empty. Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill, and heat grate until hot, about 5 minutes; scrape grate clean with grill brush. Dip wad of paper towels in oil; holding wad with tongs, wipe cooking grate. Grill is ready when side with coals is medium-hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above grate for 3 to 4 seconds).

4. Remove chicken from bag, allowing excess marinade to drip off. Place chicken on cooler side of grill, smooth-side down, with thicker side facing coals. Cover with disposable pan and cook until bottom of chicken just begins to develop light grill marks and is no longer translucent, 6 to 9 minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken and rotate so that thinner side faces coals. Cover with disposable pan and continue to cook until chicken is opaque and firm to touch and instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken registers 140 degrees, 6 to 9 minutes longer.

1 cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk
11/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for coating the bowl
31/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting
21/2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 egg
1 tablespoon sesame seeds.

1. Put the milk in a small saucepan and warm it over very low heat until lukewarm (110-115 degrees). Remove the pan from the heat. Sprinkle the yeast over the milk, stir and set aside for 5 minutes to activate. Butter a large bowl and set aside.

2. In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, combine the yeast mixture with half the flour on low speed. Over a 1-minute period, add the remaining flour along with the sugar, salt, egg and 2 tablespoons butter. Increase the speed to medium and mix for 2 minutes, then mix on high speed for 2 minutes. Transfer the dough to the prepared bowl, cover it loosely with plastic wrap and set it aside in a warm area for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in size.

3. Turn out the dough onto a floured surface. Divide it into 7 equal pieces. Keeping the other portions covered with a kitchen towel so they dont dry out, roll each piece into a ball. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Using a rolling pin, flatten the balls into rounds that are 3½ to 4 inches in diameter. Place the buns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper; put the sheet inside a large plastic bag and tie the open end closed. Leave the pan in a warm area until the buns have doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

4. Remove the sheet from the bag, brush each bun with water and sprinkle the sesame seeds on top. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool at least 10 minutes. Slice in half and serve. Makes 7. From The Big Sur Bakery Cookbook.

Serves 4.

For a potent spice flavor, brine and dry the ribs as directed, then coat them with the spice rub, wrap tightly in plastic, and refrigerate overnight before grilling. You will need two wood chunks, each about the size of a lemon, for this recipe.

INGREDIENTS
Brine
1/2	cup table salt or 1 cup kosher salt
1/2	cup granulated sugar
2	racks baby back ribs (about 2 pounds each), or loin back ribs
Spice rub
1	tablespoon sweet paprika , plus additional 1/2 teaspoon
1 1/2	teaspoons chili powder
1 3/4	teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2	teaspoons dark brown sugar
3/4	teaspoon table salt or 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
3/4	teaspoon dried oregano
3/4	teaspoon ground black pepper
1	teaspoon ground white pepper
1/2	teaspoon cayenne pepper

INSTRUCTIONS
1. To brine the ribs: Dissolve salt and sugar in 4 quarts cold water in stockpot or large plastic container. Submerge ribs in brine and refrigerate 1 hour until fully seasoned. Remove ribs from brine and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels.

2. While ribs are brining, cover two 3-inch wood chunks with water in medium bowl; soak wood chunks for 1 hour, then drain and set aside. Combine spice rub ingredients in small bowl. When ribs are out of brine and dried, rub each side of racks with 1 tablespoon spice rub; refrigerate racks 30 minutes.

3. To barbecue the ribs: Open bottom vents on grill. Ignite about 4 1/2 quarts charcoal briquettes (3/4 large chimney-full, or about 65 briquettes) and burn until covered with thin coating of light gray ash, about 20 minutes. Empty coals onto one half of grill bottom, piling them 2 to 3 briquettes high; place soaked wood chunks on top of coals. Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill, open lid vents two-thirds of the way; heat grate 5 minutes, then scrape clean with wire brush.

4. Arrange ribs on cool side of grill parallel to fire; cover, positioning lid so that vents are opposite wood chunks to draw smoke through grill (grill temperature should register about 350 degrees on grill thermometer, but will soon start dropping). Cook for 2 hours, until grill temperature drops to about 250 degrees, flipping rib racks, switching their position so that rack that was nearest fire is on outside, and turning racks 180 degrees every 30 minutes; add 10 fresh briquettes to pile of coals. Continue to cook (grill temperature should register 275 to 300 degrees on grill thermometer), flipping, switching, and rotating ribs every 30 minutes, until meat easily pulls away from bone, 1 1/2 to 2 hours longer. Transfer ribs to cutting board, then cut between bones to separate ribs; serve.$$,1,@cat4,@subcat4,PARSEDATETIME('2010-05-28', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Be sure to use instant pudding that requires no stovetop cooking for this recipe. We use regular supermarket (Persian) limes-tasters thought bottled lime juice lacked depth of flavor. We much prefer our easy homemade crust to store- bought versions.


Crust
8	whole graham crackers , broken into smaller pieces
2	tablespoons sugar 
5	tablespoons unsalted butter , melted

Filling
1/4	cup sugar 
1	tablespoon grated lime zest

1/3	cup instant vanilla pudding mix 
1 1/4	teaspoons unflavored gelatin 
1	cup fresh lime juice from 6 to 8 limes
1	teaspoon vanilla extract 

1. For the crust: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Pulse crackers and sugar in food processor until finely ground. Add melted butter in steady stream while pulsing until crumbs resemble damp sand. Using bottom of dry measuring cup, press crumbs firmly into bottom and sides of 9-inch pie plate. Bake until fragrant and browned around edges, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool completely.

2. For the filling: Process sugar and zest in food processor until sugar turns bright green, about 30 seconds. Add cream cheese and process until combined, about 30 seconds. Add condensed milk and pudding mix and process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl. Stir gelatin and 2 tablespoons lime juice in small bowl. Heat in microwave for 15 seconds; stir until dissolved. With machine running, pour gelatin mixture, remaining lime juice, and vanilla through feed tube and mix until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds.

CHELADA/MICHELADA: A LOOSE GUIDE

Use a pilsner or other tall beer or cocktail glass; a 20-ounce cooler or imperial pint works beautifully in that it allows for the ice, the additives and an entire 12-ounce bottle of beer. Cut a small lime wedge and use it to moisten the rim of the glass, then invert it onto a saucer of kosher salt, or salt mixed with chili powder. Fill the glass with as much or little ice as you wish. Then use whichever of the following ingredients fit your mood, pouring the beer in last. Do experiment with lavish versions compared to more stripped-down ones to see which you like best. Salùd!

 Fresh lime juice, about an ounce, or one limes worth. I like to save the squeezed half-hull to cap the drink, to incorporate the aromatics of the oil into it as well.

1 3/4 cups warm water
1 package active dry yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
5 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for kneading
1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus coarse sea salt, for sprinkling
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided

Combine the warm water, yeast and sugar in a small bowl. Put the bowl in a warm, not hot or cool, place until the yeast is bubbling and aromatic, at least 15 minutes.

In the bowl of a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour, 1 tablespoon of kosher salt, 1/2 cup olive oil and the yeast mixture on low speed. Once the dough has come together, continue to knead for 5 to 6 minutes on a medium speed until it becomes smooth and soft. Give it a sprinkle of flour if the dough is really sticky and tacky.

Transfer the dough to a clean, lightly floured surface, then knead it by hand 1 or 2 times. Again, give it another sprinkle of flour if the dough is really sticky and tacky.

Coat the inside of the mixer bowl lightly with olive oil and return the dough to the bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap and put it in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, at least 1 hour.

Coat a jelly roll pan with the remaining 1/2 cup olive oil. (Chef's Note: This may seem excessive, but focaccia is an oily crusted bread. This is why it is soooooooooo delicious!).

Put the dough onto the jelly roll pan and begin pressing it out to fit the size of the pan. Turn the dough over to coat the other side with the olive oil. Continue to stretch the dough to fit the pan. As you are doing so, spread your fingers out and make finger holes all the way through the dough. (Chef's Note: Yes, this is strange. But when the dough rises again it will create the characteristic craggy looking focaccia. If you do not make the actual holes in the dough, the finished product will be very smooth.)

Put the dough in the warm place until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour. While the dough is rising a second time, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Liberally sprinkle the top of the focaccia with some coarse sea salt and lightly drizzle a little oil on top. Bake the dough until the top of the loaf is golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the focaccia from the oven and let it cool before cutting and serving.$$,1,@cat2,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2010-08-12', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

1/8 teaspoon commercial bakers, brewers or Red Star Pasteur Champagne yeast
20 ounces non-chlorinated water (filtered, distilled or spring)
1 to 4 grams cream of tartar (not necessary, but traditional, to help the yeast and bacteria thrive).

1.	Take a 1.5-liter plastic bottle of spring water and empty it into a clean pitcher. Use some of it to make simple syrup by stirring 1/2 pound sugar into 1 cup hot water until fully dissolved.

2.	In a large measuring cup, mix all ingredients and stir well. Funnel back into the plastic bottle and cap tightly. Store in a warm, dark place for 24 to 48 hours. (I put mine inside a box, to contain it if it should blow.) The top of the bottle will expand and become tight. Check it and very slowly release the pressure if its looking groaningly tight. Some people ferment it with no top, or with the top on loosely, to allow gas to escape. I suppose if you wanted to get fancy you could spend $1.50 on a fermentation lock and stop worrying about it. If the temperature is quite warm, above 80F, a single day may be sufficient. The longer you let it ferment, the drier the final mix will be.

3.	After 48 hours, refrigerate it to stop the fermentation. Once chilled, you can strain out the pulp and dead yeast, which will have made a sediment on the bottom. Makes 1 liter and will keep up to a week in the refrigerator.

Time: 4 1/2 hours

2 oxtails, about 3 pounds each, cut in 4- to 5-inch sections
Salt and black pepper
3 medium onions, diced
2 cloves garlic, 1 sliced
1/4 pound piece Serrano ham, diced

1 bay leaf
Pinch crushed red chili flakes
1 cup dry red wine
2 cups beef stock
2 jars (7.8 ounces) piquillo peppers, drained and patted dry, about 24.

1. Discard the narrow end section of each oxtail. Season the rest with salt and pepper and brown over high heat in a 6-quart casserole or braising pan. Remove. Reduce heat to low. Add 2/3 of the diced onions, the sliced garlic clove and the ham. Sauté until onions are soft.

2. Meanwhile, by hand or in food processor, finely chop the remaining onion and garlic with the green pepper and the parsley. Mix with the tomato. Add to the pan when the onions are soft, and reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring, until all vegetables are soft. Stir in the bay leaf, chili flakes, wine and stock. Raise heat and bring to a simmer.

3. Return oxtails to pan, baste, cover and reduce heat to very low. Cook about 3 hours, turning once, until meat is fork tender. Remove oxtails to cool. Strain liquid and reserve, discarding solids. Finely chop or shred meat and mix with 2/3 cup of the liquid.

2 ounces dried red chili, such as Nora or Ancho, stemmed and seeded
1 fleshy red bell or pimento pepper
1 teaspoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon red-wine vinegar
Salt to taste
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons coriander seeds, toasted
2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted
½ teaspoon caraway seeds, toasted
3 garlic cloves, peeled
Cayenne pepper to taste.

1. On a sheet tray, toast the dried chili peppers in a 350-degree oven until they start to smell good. Be careful not to burn them, as they go from nicely toasted to burned in a matter of seconds. Place in a bowl and cover with hot water, leaving them to rehydrate for about 20 minutes.

2. Grill or broil the bell or pimento pepper until well charred and blistered. Seal in a paper bag for 20 minutes to steam. Scrape the charred skin off the pepper and remove, discarding the seeds and stem. Avoid the temptation to rinse the pepper while cleaning it, as its delicious oils would be lost.

3. Drain the chilies and place in a blender jar with the roasted pepper, tomato paste, vinegar, a good pinch of salt and about a quarter of the olive oil. Blend to a thick, fairly smooth paste, adding more oil as needed to facilitate blending. Transfer to a medium bowl.

4. Coarsely grind the toasted spices in a mortar and add to the pepper mixture. Pound the garlic cloves to a paste with a pinch of salt in the mortar and add to the mixture. Slowly mix in the rest of the oil with a spoon, not being overly concerned with creating an even consistency. Taste and adjust with salt and cayenne. The oil will rise and stay somewhat separate from the chili solids, allowing the harissa to be preserved in the fridge for months. Just stir together before using it. The oil itself is a delicious flavoring agent. From Mike Emanuel.

By MIKE EMANUEL
This recipe adapts beautifully to lamb shoulder.

1 bone-in goat shoulder, about 4 pounds (look for the meaty Boer breed)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
½ cup harissa (see <a href=\"http://www.mathin.com/recipes/index.cgi?action=display&id=540\">recipe here</a>, or use store-bought)
1 large onion, peeled and sliced
2 carrots, peeled and sliced
4 garlic cloves, smashed
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon coriander seeds or a few sprigs fresh cilantro
1 cinnamon stick
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 cups low-sodium chicken stock or water
½ cup white wine
1 tablespoon honey
½ Moroccan preserved lemon, rinsed and inner flesh removed, finely chopped
2 sprigs mint leaves, roughly torn.

1. The evening before you plan to cook the shoulder, season it generously with salt, pepper and ¼ cup of the harissa. Refrigerate overnight and start to bring it to room temperature two hours before you plan to cook it.  

2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large Dutch oven set over medium heat, cook the onion, carrots, garlic and spices for a few minutes in the olive oil until fragrant and slightly browned. If using cilantro sprigs, tuck them into the vegetables after theyve cooked. Lay the shoulder over the vegetables.

3. In a small saucepan, bring the stock, wine and honey to a simmer and pour it over the goat. Cook uncovered in the oven for about 1 hour, adjusting the temperature so the juices maintain a very gentle simmer. Add a little more broth or water if it gets too low. Carefully turn the shoulder over and return to the oven. After 30 minutes, turn again and repeat every 30 minutes until the meat is very tender and nearly falling off the bone. Total cooking time will be 2½ to 3 hours. The slower it cooks, the more meltingly tender it will be. Cool in its juices.

4. Remove the shoulder and strain the liquid into a bowl, pushing some of the solids through the strainer. Let the liquid settle for a few minutes, then skim off all of the fat. This is made easier if you refrigerate the juices for a half hour or so, partially solidifying the fat.

5.  To serve, gently reheat the meat in the juices and stir in the preserved lemon and sprinkle with mint. Serve with more harissa, yogurt and aromatic baked rice (recipe follows). Serves 4. From Mike Emanuel.$$,1,@cat4,@subcat2,PARSEDATETIME('2010-10-06', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

By CHAD ROBERTSON

For the starter:
¾ cup white all-purpose flour
¾ cup whole-wheat flour
7  ounces water (70 degrees)
¼ teaspoons active dry yeast

For the dough:
3 cups water (70 degrees)
7 cups white all-purpose flour
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons whole wheat all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon salt.

1. To make the starter, mix the ingredients in a medium bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let stand at cool room temperature overnight (10 to 12 hours). If you are not ready to mix your dough after 12 hours at room temperature, put the starter in the refrigerator for up to 8 hours.

2. To mix the dough, add the water to a large bowl. Add the starter and stir to disperse. Add 7 cups of white flour and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons whole-wheat flour. With a rubber spatula, mix thoroughly until no pockets of flour remain. Cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest for 20 to 40 minutes.

3. After the rest, add the salt and mix to incorporate into the dough. You can add a spritz of water to help dissolve the salt. Re-cover and let the dough rise 2 to 2 1/2 hours at moderately warm room temperature (75 degrees), giving it a dozen turns in the bowl every half hour to continue to develop.

4. After this initial (bulk) rise, you are ready to portion your dough into individual pieces for pizza and, if you like, retard the rising for another day in the fridge to develop more flavor. Portion the dough into 8 pieces and place each into small, olive-oil-brushed containers. Cover with plastic wrap. If youd like to use the dough on the same day, let it rise at the same moderate warm room temperature for another 2 to 4 hours, then use to make pizza. If retarding the rising, cover and place in the fridge for up to 16 hours.

5. When you are ready to make pizza, preheat oven and pizza stone, if using, to 475 degrees. Remove dough from the oiled cups and place on a floured work surface, preferably the peel you will use to slide the pizza into the oven. Stretch the dough over your hands to your preferred thickness. Top as you like and peel into the hot oven to bake, about 18 minutes. Makes 8 8-inch pizzas. From Tartine Bread, by Chad Robertson.

NOTE: To make pita-style flatbreads, roll dough thin with a floured rolling pin and cook for a few minutes on one side until the dough puffs completely, forming a dough pillow filled with air. After its puffed on one side, flip and let the other side cook for a few minutes until its done.

Time: 20 minutes

2 cups cake flour, more as needed
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
3 tablespoons sugar
5 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces
1 egg
1/2 to 3/4 cup heavy cream, more for brushing.
1. Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Put the flour, salt, baking powder and 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles cornmeal.

2. Add the egg and just enough cream to form a slightly sticky dough. If its too sticky, add a little flour, but very little; it should still stick a little to your hands.

3. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead once or twice, then press it into a 3/4-inch-thick circle and cut into 2-inch rounds with a biscuit cutter or glass. Put the rounds on an ungreased baking sheet. Gently reshape the leftover dough and cut again. Brush the top of each scone with a bit of cream and sprinkle with a little of the remaining sugar.

Serves 4.   Published November 1, 2007.   From Cook's Illustrated.

Russet potatoes will yield a slightly fluffier, less creamy mash, but they can be used in place of the Yukon Gold potatoes if desired. Rinsing the potatoes in several changes of water reduces starch and prevents the mashed potatoes from becoming gluey. It is important to cut the potatoes and root vegetables into even-sized pieces so they cook at the same rate. This recipe can be doubled and cooked in a large Dutch oven. If doubling, increase the cooking time in step 2 to 40 minutes. This variation is particularly nice with turnips.


4	ounces bacon , cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2	tablespoons unsalted butter
8	ounces carrots , parsnips, turnips, or celery root, peeled; carrots or parsnips cut into 1/4-inch-thick half-moons; turnips or celery root cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 1 1/2 cups)
1 1/2	pounds Yukon Gold potatoes , peeled, quartered lengthwise, and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices; rinsed well in 3 or 4 changes of cold water and drained well
1/3	cup low-sodium chicken broth
Table salt
3/4	cup half-and-half , warmed
1	teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
Ground black pepper

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Cook 4 slices (about 4 ounces) bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, in large saucepan over medium heat until browned and crisp, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel-lined plate; set aside. Remove all but 2 tablespoons bacon fat from pan.

2. Add butter to pan and keep over medium heat. When foaming subsides, add root vegetables and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter is browned and vegetables are dark brown and caramelized, 10 to 12 minutes. (If after 4 minutes vegetables have not started to brown, increase heat to medium-high.)

3. Add potatoes, broth, and 3/4 teaspoon salt and stir to combine. Cook, covered, over low heat (broth should simmer gently; do not boil), stirring occasionally, until potatoes fall apart easily when poked with fork and all liquid has been absorbed, 25 to 30 minutes. (If liquid does not gently simmer after a few minutes, increase heat to medium-low.) Remove pan from heat; remove lid and allow steam to escape for 2 minutes.

4. Gently mash potatoes and root vegetables in saucepan with potato masher (do not mash vigorously). Gently fold in warm half-and-half, reserved bacon, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper to taste; serve immediately.$$,1,@cat8,@subcat7,PARSEDATETIME('2010-10-19', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Approximately 8 feet sausage casing, packed in salt (optional; see note)

2 pounds pork belly, rind removed, cut into 1-inch chunks, well chilled
1	pound lean beef, cut into 1-inch chunks, well chilled
3	slices white bread
¼	cup guajillo chiles, deseeded, rehydrated and puréed with 3 tablespoons simmering liquid
¼	cup tomato paste
2	tablespoons kosher salt
1½	tablespoons crushed garlic
2	teaspoons dried Mexican oregano
2	tablespoons cumin seed, toasted and ground
1	teaspoon coriander seed, toasted and ground
1	tablespoon cayenne
1	teaspoon white vinegar.

1.	If you are making sausage links, thoroughly rinse the casing of salt and soak it in a large pot of cold water overnight. Thoroughly rinse the casing again and place it in fresh, cold water until ready to use.

2.	Attach the knife and grinding-plate attachments to a stand mixer. Run the pork and beef through the grinder into a large bowl, followed by a slice of bread to push out any bits of meat stuck inside the works. Discard any ground bread. Add the remaining ingredients and mix together with your hands. Knead the meat until it seizes up and holds together, about 2 minutes. At this point you can shape the sausage mixture into patties.

3.	If you are making links, replace the grinding plate with a stuffer attachment with a ¾-inch opening. Select a length of casing and run water from the tap through it in order to clear out any excess salt and spot any holes, which you should trim out. Cut a length of casing at least 3 to 4 feet long; tie it off. Run the casing between your fingers to remove excess water. Stretch the open end of the casing around the attachments nozzle and gradually slide the rest of the casing onto the nozzle, an inch or 2 at a time. Leave about 3 inches at the knotted end dangling free. Put the sausage in the hopper of the grinder and turn it on (Speed 4 tends to work best). Hold the dangling casing with one hand, and with the other, feed the sausage mixture into the hopper with a wooden pestle at an even pace. When 2 inches of casing are empty at both the knotted and free ends, stop stuffing and slowly pull on the casing to free it from the stuffer nozzle. Run your fingers over the casing to distribute the sausage evenly. Pinch the middle of the sausage and gently twist it to form two long links. Keep pinching and twisting to form links 4 or 5 inches long. Repeat this process until all of the sausage meat has been used, pushing out the last bits of meat with another slice or two of bread.

4.	Whether youve made patties or links, refrigerating the sausage overnight, wrapped in wax paper, will help it hold together as it cooks. To cook, snip off a single length containing as many individual sausages as you like. Dont separate the links until they have been cooked (in an oiled skillet, on the grill or under the broiler). Any uncooked remainders will freeze well. Makes 14 sausages. Adapted from Tom Mylan and Sara Bigelow at the Meat Hook in Brooklyn.

Note: Sausage casing can be bought from most sausage-making butchers or ordered online at Amazon.com.

2. Pour dry ingredients into wet; whisk until just blended (do not overmix). Batter should be slightly thicker than cream. If its too thick, add some milk; if its too thin, sprinkle with additional flour. Stir in the carrots, zucchini and scallions. Allow to rest for 30 minutes.

3. To make the yogurt dip: using a mortar and pestle or the back of a knife, mash together the garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt. In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic paste, yogurt, mint and 1 tablespoon extra virgin oil. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

4. Fill a wide saucepan with 1 inch of olive oil; heat until the temperature registers 375 degrees on a deep-fry thermometer (or until a small drip of batter browns immediately). Line a cookie sheet with paper towels. Working in batches, drop battered vegetables by the tablespoon into the oil, being sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry, turning occasionally, until golden all over, about 3 to 4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer fritters to the cookie sheet to drain. Transfer fritters to a platter or plate; sprinkle with salt and serve with yogurt dip.

Time: About 1 1/2 hours, largely unattended

Salt
1 large head Savoy cabbage (or kale), separated into leaves
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium onions, chopped
3 tablespoons minced garlic
1 medium carrot, shredded
1 medium parsnip, shredded
2/3 to 3/4 pound ground lamb (or beef)
3/4 cup short-grain rice
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper, or more to taste.

1. Bring a large pot of water to boil and salt it. Add the cabbage leaves to the boiling water a few at a time and cook for 30 seconds to one minute, or until theyre just pliable. Carefully remove the leaves from the water with a slotted spoon and transfer to a colander; rinse with cold water. Repeat with the remaining leaves. Gently squeeze the leaves to remove most of the excess water, leaving them just damp enough so they will stick together when rolled.

2. Put 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat; when hot, add half the chopped onion and one tablespoon of the garlic, along with the carrot and the parsnip, and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl along with the lamb and rice. Mix until just combined.

3. Wipe the pan, add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and turn the heat to medium-high. When the oil is hot, add the remaining onion and garlic and cook until soft, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, red pepper and a good sprinkling of salt; cook over medium-low heat while you prepare the cabbage leaves.

4. Cut the cabbage leaves in half by running a sharp knife along each side of the stem, removing the stem in the process; trim the top and bottom so youre left with a large rectangle. Lay a leaf on a work surface with the wide edge facing you. Put a couple tablespoons of the meat mixture in the middle of the leaf, fold in the two sides of the leaf and roll it up as you would a burrito. Repeat with the remaining leaves and filling.

5. Add the cabbage rolls, seam side down, to the pot of sauce. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, stirring the sauce occasionally and adding a tablespoon or two of water if the sauce becomes too thick, until the meat and rice are both fully cooked (cut into a roll to check; the rice should be tender and the meat no longer pink), 30 to 45 minutes.

Makes 2 very generous servings

1 pumpkin, about 3 pounds

Salt and freshly ground pepper

1/4 pound stale bread, thinly sliced and cut into 1/2-inch chunks

1/4 pound cheese, such as Gruyere, Emmenthal, cheddar, or a combination, cut into 1/2-inch chunks

24 garlic cloves (to taste), split, germ removed, and coarsely chopped

4 strips bacon, cooked until crisp, drained, and chopped

About 1/4 cup snipped fresh chives or sliced scallions

1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme

About 1/3 cup heavy cream

Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg

Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment, or find a Dutch oven with a diameter that's just a tiny bit larger than your pumpkin. If you bake the pumpkin in a casserole, it will keep its shape, but it might stick to the casserole, so you'll have to serve it from the pot  which is an appealingly homey way to serve it. If you bake it on a baking sheet, you can present it freestanding, but maneuvering a heavy stuffed pumpkin with a softened shell isn't so easy. However, since I love the way the unencumbered pumpkin looks in the center of the table, I've always taken my chances with the baked-on-a-sheet method, and so far, I've been lucky.

Using a very sturdy knife  and caution  cut a cap out of the top of the pumpkin (think Halloween jack-o'-lantern). It's easiest to work your knife around the top of the pumpkin at a 45-degree angle. You want to cut off enough of the top to make it easy for you to work inside the pumpkin. Clear away the seeds and strings from the cap and from inside the pumpkin. Season the inside of the pumpkin generously with salt and pepper, and put it on the baking sheet or in the pot. Toss the bread, cheese, garlic, bacon, and herbs together in a bowl. Season with pepper  you probably have enough salt from the bacon and cheese, but taste to be sure  and pack the mix into the pumpkin. The pumpkin should be well filled  you might have a little too much filling, or you might need to add to it. Stir the cream with the nutmeg and some salt and pepper and pour it into the pumpkin. Again, you might have too much or too little  you don't want the ingredients to swim in cream, but you do want them nicely moistened. (But it's hard to go wrong here.)

Put the cap in place and bake the pumpkin for about 2 hours  check after 90 minutes  or until everything inside the pumpkin is bubbling and the flesh of the pumpkin is tender enough to be pierced easily with the tip of a knife. Because the pumpkin will have exuded liquid, I like to remove the cap during the last 20 minutes or so, so that the liquid can bake away and the top of the stuffing can brown a little.

When the pumpkin is ready, carefully, very carefully  it's heavy, hot, and wobbly  bring it to the table or transfer it to a platter that you'll bring to the table.

Serving

You have choices: you can cut wedges of the pumpkin and filling; you can spoon out portions of the filling, making sure to get a generous amount of pumpkin into the spoonful; or you can dig into the pumpkin with a big spoon, pull the pumpkin meat into the filling, and then mix everything up. I'm a fan of the pull-and-mix option. Served in hearty portions followed by a salad, the pumpkin is a perfect cold-weather main course; served in generous spoonfuls or wedges, it's just right alongside the Thanksgiving turkey.

Storing

It's really best to eat this as soon as it's ready. However, if you've got leftovers, you can scoop them out of the pumpkin, mix them up, cover, and chill them; reheat them the next day.

Greenspan's Stuffing Ideas

There are many ways to vary this arts-and-crafts project. Instead of bread, I've filled the pumpkin with cooked rice  when it's baked, it's almost risotto-like. And, with either bread or rice, on different occasions I've added cooked spinach, kale, chard, or peas (the peas came straight from the freezer). I've made it without bacon, and I've also made and loved, loved, loved it with cooked sausage meat; cubes of ham are another good idea. Nuts are a great addition, as are chunks of apple or pear or pieces of chestnut$$,1,@cat8,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2010-11-15', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Summary:

Turkeys take well to the grill. Their size accommodates long hours of smoking, and their mild flavor benefits from the woodsy infusion of light wood smoke.

You'll need 2 cups of pecan or applewood chips that have been soaked in water for at least 1 hour.

MAKE AHEAD: The turkey needs to be brined in the refrigerator for 12 to 20 hours. If you don't have space in the refrigerator, set up a cooler with ice.

12 to 14 servings

Ingredients:

For the brine
 14 cups water
 4 cups apple juice, preferably unsweetened and unfiltered
 1 cup bourbon
 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar
 1 1/4 cups salt
 4 bay leaves
 12 whole black peppercorns
 1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
 4 medium cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
 4 strips lemon peel (little or no pith)

For the brine and bird
 One 15-pound turkey (giblets removed)

For the rub
 2 tablespoons ground sage
 2 tablespoons dried rosemary
 2 tablespoons dried thyme
 2 tablespoons salt
 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper

For the bird
 10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
 1 large onion, cut into quarters
 1 medium tart apple, such as Granny Smith, cored and cut into quarters
 1 medium fennel bulb, cored and cut into quarters

Directions:

For the brine: Line a large mixing bowl or clean bucket with a 2-gallon resealable plastic food storage bag or a large brining bag; add the water, apple juice, bourbon, brown sugar, salt, bay leaves, peppercorns, onion, garlic and strips of lemon peel, stirring to dissolve the sugar and salt. Place the turkey in the brine and seal, pressing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate for 12 to 20 hours, repositioning the turkey halfway through as needed to make sure the bird is evenly brined.

Rinse the turkey and pat it dry; discard the brine.

For the rub: Combine the sage, rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper in a small bowl.

For the bird: Soak the 2 cups of pecan or applewood chips for at least 1 hour.

Prepare the grill for indirect heat: If using a charcoal grill, light the coals. Drain the water from the wood chips. If using a gas grill, place 1 cup of the chips in a smoker box or an aluminum foil pouch punctured with a fork on top to release smoke.

If using a charcoal grill, place a drip pan beneath the grates on the indirect side of the grill. When the coals are white-hot, scatter 1 cup of the wood chips directly onto the coals. If using a gas grill, place a drip pan directly on the flavorizer bars, briquettes or lava rocks. Place the smoker box or foil pouch between the grate and briquettes, close to the flame. Preheat on high until you see smoke, then reduce the heat to medium (350 degrees).

Coat the cavity and skin of the turkey with butter. Coat the cavity with 2 tablespoons of the rub, then use the remainder of the rub to coat the buttered skin of the bird. Place the onion, apple and fennel pieces in the cavity.

Place the turkey, breast side up, on the indirect side of the grill, over the drip pan. Cover the charcoal grill and leave the vents open. Close the lid of the gas grill.

After 1 hour, add a dozen briquettes and the remaining cup of chips directly onto the charcoal fire. If using a gas grill, add the remaining chips to the smoker box or remove the foil pouch and replace it with a second pouch. Baste the turkey with drippings every 20 minutes until it is done.

After 2 hours, insert a meat thermometer into thickest part of the breast without touching the bone. The bird is done when the temperature reads 170 degrees (between 2 and 3 hours).

Transfer the turkey to a cutting board. Discard the onion mixture in the cavity, if desired. Let the bird rest for 15 minutes before carving.

Time: 1 hour 20 minutes

2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
1 1/3 cups graham cracker crumbs, made from one package graham crackers, which has 9 full cracker sheets
1/4 cup shredded unsweetened coconut
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons ground ginger
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, melted
3 eggs
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Pinch ground cloves
Large pinch of salt
1 cup coconut milk.

1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Put the sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan, add water to cover by about 1 inch, and bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the potatoes are very tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain, then rice the potatoes or run them through a food mill.

2. While the potatoes cook, put the graham crackers in a food processor and pulse several times until they are finely ground. Add the shredded coconut, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of the ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon of the cinnamon, and pulse once or twice; add the melted butter and pulse just to combine. Press the mixture into a 9-inch pie dish and bake for about 7 minutes; remove the crust from the oven and cool.

3. In a food processor, combine the eggs with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, the remaining ginger and cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt; pulse until well combined. Add the coconut milk and pulse to combine, then add the sweet potatoes and pulse until just smooth.

4. Put the pie plate on a baking sheet. Pour the sweet potato mixture into the crust and bake until the mixture is set on top but still quite moist, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool on a rack and serve warm or at room temperature.

INGREDIENTS

Enchilada sauce:
7 Tbsp chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon crushed oregano
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup flour
2 Tbsp olive oil
2 cups of turkey or chicken stock

Enchilada filling:
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 to 2 jalapeño chili peppers (1 for mild, 2 or more for spicy), seeded, minced
3 cups cooked turkey meat, chopped
1 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained
8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, grated (makes 2 cups grated cheese)
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 Tbsp lime juice (can sub lemon juice)
1 to 2 teaspoons salt or more to taste
8-16 flour tortillas, depending on size and thickness

Garnishes:
Chopped red onion
Chopped avocado
Chopped fresh cilantro
Sour cream or crema fresca
Ice berg lettuce, sliced thin and sprinkled with salt and vinegar

METHOD
1 First make the enchilada sauce. In a medium bowl, whisk together the chili powder, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, cinnamon, ground cloves, sugar, salt, and flour. Heat olive oil on medium heat in a cast iron pan (or other thick-bottomed sauté pan). Add the spices and cook for a minute or tow, until fragrant. Slowly whisk in the stock, until smooth. Let come to a simmer, cook for a minute, then remove from heat, cover and set aside.

2 Prepare the filling. Heat olive oil in a sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and jalapeños and cook until the onions are translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook a minute more. Remove from heat. Place onion mixture in a medium mixing bowl. Mix in the cooked turkey meat, the beans, 1 cup of the grated cheese, 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro, 2 Tbsp lime juice, and 1/2 a cup of the enchilada sauce. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of salt, or more to taste. Set aside.

3 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat the pan with the enchilada sauce on medium heat. Spread 1/2 cup of the sauce over the bottom of a 9x13 casserole dish (pyrex works well). Working one at a time, dip the flour tortillas in the sauce to coat them on both sides. If the sauce is too thick, thin it with a little water. Place the tortilla in the casserole dish and place anywhere from 1/4 of a cup to 1/2 cup of the filling in the middle of the tortilla. Roll up the tortilla around the filling and place it in the casserole dish. Continue to roll up the rest of your tortillas until they fill the casserole dish. Cover the enchiladas with the remaining sauce, and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Place in the oven and bake, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the enchiladas are heated through and the cheese has melted.

4 Sprinkle with a little more lime juice before serving. Serve with chopped red onion, chopped avocado, fresh cilantro, sour cream or crema fresca, and thinly sliced ice berg lettuce that has been dressed with vinegar and salt (no oil).

Serves 6.

Make sure that the ribs are at least 4 inches long and 1 inch thick. If boneless ribs are unavailable, substitute 7 pounds of bone-in beef short ribs at least 4 inches long with 1 inch of meat above the bone. To remove the meat from the bone, see the illustrations below. We recommend a bold red wine such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Côtes du Rhône. The test kitchens preferred brand of beef broth is Pacific. Serve with egg noodles, mashed potatoes, or roasted potatoes.


3 1/2	pounds boneless short ribs , trimmed of excess fat (see note and technique below)
Kosher salt and ground black pepper
2	tablespoons vegetable oil
2	large onions , peeled and sliced thin from pole to pole (about 4 cups)
1	tablespoon tomato paste
6	medium garlic cloves , peeled
2	cups red wine (see note)
1	cup beef broth
4	 large carrots , peeled and cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces
4	sprigs fresh thyme
1	 bay leaf
1/4	cup cold water
1/2	teaspoon unflavored powdered gelatin

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Pat beef dry with paper towels and season with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium-high heat until smoking. Add half of beef and cook, without moving, until well browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Turn beef and continue to cook on second side until well browned, 4 to 6 minutes longer, reducing heat if fat begins to smoke. Transfer beef to medium bowl. Repeat with remaining tablespoon oil and meat.

2. Reduce heat to medium, add onions, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, 12 to 15 minutes. (If onions begin to darken too quickly, add 1 to 2 tablespoons water to pan.) Add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until it browns on sides and bottom of pan, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Increase heat to medium-high, add wine and simmer, scraping bottom of pan with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits, until reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes. Add broth, carrots, thyme, and bay leaf. Add beef and any accumulated juices to pot; cover and bring to simmer. Transfer pot to oven and cook, using tongs to turn meat twice during cooking, until fork slips easily in and out of meat, 2 to 2½ hours.

3. Place water in small bowl and sprinkle gelatin on top; let stand at least 5 minutes. Using tongs, transfer meat and carrots to serving platter and tent with foil. Strain cooking liquid through fine-mesh strainer into fat separator or bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Allow liquid to settle about 5 minutes and strain off fat. Return cooking liquid to Dutch oven and cook over medium heat until reduced to 1 cup, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in gelatin mixture; season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over meat and serve.$$,1,@cat4,@subcat1,PARSEDATETIME('2010-12-03', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

1/2 to 3/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves
1/4 cup roughly chopped scallions, white parts only
10 to 12 round dumpling skins
Juice of 1 lime.
1. Combine the soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil and ginger in a bowl. Put half the shrimp, half the cilantro and all the scallions in a food processor and pulse; add just enough of the soy mixture to create a smooth paste, about 1 to 2 tablespoons. Transfer to a bowl. Roughly chop the remaining shrimp and cilantro, add them to the bowl and stir to combine.

2. Place a dumpling skin on a work surface, moisten the edges with water, and put 1 teaspoon of the filling in the center. Gather the edges of the wrapper up around the filling, squeezing gently, to pleat the sides; some of the filling should remain exposed. Repeat with the remaining dumpling skins and filling, keeping the dumpling wrappers and dumplings covered with damp towels while you work.

3. Rig a steamer in a large pot over an inch of water; bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Meanwhile, add the lime juice to the remaining soy mixture to make a dipping sauce.

4. Put as many dumplings in the steamer as you can fit in a single layer and cover the pot. Cook until the exposed filling turns pink and the wrappers are tender, 4 to 6 minutes, then transfer the dumplings to a serving platter. Repeat with the remaining dumplings. Serve with the dipping sauce.

While the waffles can be eaten as soon as they are removed from the waffle iron, they will have a crispier exterior if rested in a warm oven for 10 minutes. (This method also makes it possible to serve everyone at the same time.) Buttermilk powder is available in most supermarkets and is generally located near the dried-milk products or in the baking aisle. Leftover buttermilk powder, which can be used in a number of baking applications, can be kept in the refrigerator for up to a year. Seltzer or club soda gives these waffles a light texture that would otherwise be provided by whipped egg whites. (Avoid sparkling water such as Perrierits not bubbly enough.) Use a freshly opened container for maximum lift. Serve waffles with butter and warmed maple syrup.

For a kale salad to be successful, use the most tender kale you can find and cut it into very thin filaments or chop it very finely (or both). Curly kale and Russian kale are more tender than black leaf kale. This is inspired by a wonderful salad I tried recently at the New York restaurant Northern Spy.

4 cups very finely chopped or slivered curly kale or Russian kale (about 6 ounces on the stem, or half of a 3/4-pound bunch, stemmed and washed in two rinses of water)

2 tablespoons coarsely chopped toasted almonds

1 apple, sweet, like a Fuji, or a sweet-tart, like a Gala, Braeburn or Pink Lady, cored and cut in 1/4-inch dice

1 ounce sharp Cheddar cheese, cut in 1/4-inch dice

2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Salt to taste

1 very small garlic clove, puréed

5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan

1. Combine the kale, almonds, apple and Cheddar in a large bowl.

2. Whisk together the lemon juice, salt, garlic and olive oil. Add to the salad, and toss well. Sprinkle the Parmesan over the top, and serve.

Yield: Serves four to six.

Advance preparation: This salad benefits from tossing with the dressing about 15 minutes before you serve it. The kale will soften in the dressing.

Time: At least 1 hour

2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed
1 teaspoon salt, plus more as needed
2 whole eggs
3 egg yolks
2 cups loosely packed basil leaves, rinsed and dried
1/2 clove garlic, peeled, or more to taste
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, or more as desired
1/4 cup pine nuts
1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish
Pepper.

1. Pulse flour and salt in a food processor once or twice. Add the eggs and yolks, and turn the machine on. Process just until a ball begins to form, about 30 seconds. Add a few drops of water if the dough is dry and grainy; add a tablespoon of flour if the dough sticks to the side of the bowl. Turn the dough out of the food processor, sprinkle it with a little flour, cover it with plastic or a cloth, and let it rest for about 30 minutes. (At this point, you may refrigerate the dough, wrapped in plastic, until youre ready to roll it out, for up to 24 hours.)

2. Meanwhile, in a food processor or blender, combine the basil with a pinch of salt, the garlic and about half the oil. Process, stopping to scrape down the sides of the container if necessary, and adding the rest of the oil gradually. Add the nuts and cheese, and pulse a few times. The pesto should be well combined but still chunky.

3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it. Divide the dough in half. Turn one half of the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll it into a large rectangle no thicker than 1/4 inch and ideally closer to 1/8 inch, adding additional flour sparingly as necessary. Repeat with the rest of the dough.

4. Cut into squares no larger than 4 inches across. Drop the squares into the water and cook until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain, reserving a little of the cooking water. Toss the handkerchiefs with the pesto, some salt and pepper, and a spoonful of cooking water, if necessary, to thin the pesto. Serve immediately, garnished with Parmesan.

Time: 45 minutes

6 large eggs
2 fat garlic cloves, finely chopped
Pinch kosher salt
1 pound Italian sausage, casings removed
1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup panko bread crumbs
Olive oil, for frying
Cornichons or other pickles, for serving.

1. Place 4 eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat; remove from heat and cover for 3 minutes. Uncover and allow to sit for 10 minutes. Peel eggs under running cold water and pat dry.

2. Using a mortar and pestle or the back of a knife, mash the garlic with a pinch of salt until a paste forms. In a medium bowl, knead together the sausage, garlic paste and horseradish until just combined. Divide into 4 equal portions.

3. In a small bowl, lightly beat the remaining 2 eggs. Place the flour and panko in separate bowls. Coat each hard-boiled egg in flour and then enclose each one completely in a sausage patty, molding the sausage into place. Dredge the sausage-coated eggs in the flour, shaking off the excess. Dip them in the beaten eggs, letting the excess drip off, and roll them in the panko, coating well.

4. Fill a medium pot with 1/2-inch oil. Heat to 350 degrees, or until the oil is shimmering and bubbling slightly around the edges. Fry the eggs, 2 at a time, turning them occasionally until golden and cooked through, about 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt and serve while still warm, with pickles.

Time: 30 minutes with cooked oatmeal

1/4 cup whole-wheat flour
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup rolled oats
1/3 cup chopped almonds
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/2 cup milk
2 cups cooked oatmeal
1/3 cup chopped dried apricots
Vegetable or olive oil, for frying
Honey, for serving.

1. Heat the oven to 200 degrees. Combine the flours, oats, almonds, baking powder, cardamom and salt in a large bowl.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and milk; stir in the cooked oatmeal and the apricots until just incorporated. Add the oatmeal mixture to the dry ingredients and stir gently; dont overmix. The consistency should be that of thick pancake batter; add a little more milk or whole-wheat flour as needed.

3. Put a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. When a few drops of water dance on its surface, add a thin film of vegetable oil and let it become hot. Spoon out the batter, making any size pancakes you like. Cook until bubbles form on the top and pop, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook until theyre browned on the other side, a couple of minutes more. You may have to rotate the cakes to cook them evenly, depending on the heat source and pan. As they finish, transfer them to a plate in the oven while you cook the remaining batter. Serve with honey.

3	tablespoons tomato ketchup
1	cup butter beans, or a 10.5-ounce can butter beans, rinsed and drained

1. Season oxtails aggressively with salt and pepper. Heat a large Dutch oven or a heavy-bottomed pot over high heat. Add brown sugar to pot and melt, stirring with a wooden spoon, until it darkens and starts to smoke ­ about six minutes. When sugar is nearly black, add 2 tablespoons boiling water. (It will splatter.) Stir to mix.

3. Add half of the onions, garlic and ginger to the pot, along with the pepper, the thyme, the allspice and a third of the scallions, and stir to combine. Allow to cook until softened, approximately 5 minutes.

4. Return the oxtails to the pot along with any accumulated juices and put water into the pot so that the oxtails are almost submerged. Bring to a simmer and then cook, covered, approximately 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

5. Add remaining onions, garlic and ginger to the pot, along with another third of the scallions. Add sugar, soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to combine and continue to cook until the meat is yielding and loose on the bone, approximately one hour longer. Remove approximately one cup of liquid from pot and place in a small bowl. Add flour to this liquid and stir to combine, working out any lumps with the back of a spoon. Add this slurry to the pot along with ketchup, then stir to combine and allow to cook a further 15 minutes or so. Remove Scotch bonnet pepper and thyme stems. Fold butter beans into the stew and allow these to heat through. Scatter remaining scallions over the top.

2	cups marinara sauce
Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving.

1.	Make the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine bread crumbs and cream. Let it sit for 5 minutes, then mash the mixture with a fork. Mix in the oregano, pepper flakes, black pepper, salt and bacon. Gently work in the pork, veal and beef. Be careful not to knead it into oblivion, or the meatballs will be tough little pebbles. Fry a little of the mixture in some butter and oil in a skillet and taste, adjusting seasonings. Roll into small meatballs, about an inch across. (If you have a kitchen scale, measure an ounce apiece.)

2.	Heat the oven to 375 degrees. In a large sauté pan, warm the butter and olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown the meatballs, turning every couple of minutes. (Work in batches if they wont all fit in the pan.) Transfer them to a roasting pan big enough to hold them all. Pour 2 cups of cold water into the pan and transfer it to the oven to bake for 20 to 30 minutes or so, until the meatballs are cooked through. Transfer to a plate and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.

3.	Boil the spaghetti in a large pot of salted water, and heat the marinara sauce in a pot. When the spaghetti is tender, toss it with the sauce. Season to taste. Put the cheese in a bowl and set it on the table. Make sure to ask your family if they want their meatballs on top of the spaghetti or on the side. 

Serves 6.

By MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN
To this colorful winter hash Ive added cooked black rice, which contributes a chewy texture and an earthy flavor that plays well against the sweetness of the squash and the seared brussels sprouts.

1 1/2 pounds winter squash, like butternut, halved, seeds and membranes scraped away
1 pound brussels sprouts, preferably small ones
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 bunch scallions, sliced thin
2 garlic cloves, minced
Salt and freshly ground pepper
2 tablespoons tomato paste, dissolved in 1/4 cup water
1 cup cooked black rice
Poached eggs for serving (optional)

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Cover a baking sheet with foil, and lightly oil the foil. Brush the cut sides of the squash with olive oil, and set on the baking sheet with the cut sides down. Bake 30 to 40 minutes until easily pierced with a paring knife. Remove from the heat, allow to cool until it can be handled, and peel and dice.

2. While the squash is in the oven, trim away the bottoms of the brussels sprouts and cut into quarters.

3. Heat the oil over medium-high in a large, heavy skillet. Add the brussels sprouts. Cook, stirring often or tossing in the pan, until just tender and the edges are seared light brown, about five minutes. Add salt to taste, and stir in the scallions and garlic. Stir together for a few minutes until the scallions and garlic are fragrant. Stir in the squash. Cook, stirring often, until the squash has caramelized lightly, about 10 minutes. Its fine if the squash falls apart in the pan. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in the dissolved tomato paste. Continue to cook, stirring, until the tomato paste has caramelized, about five minutes. The tomato paste mixture will no longer be visible, but there should be rusty-colored traces on the bottom of your skillet. Stir in the black rice. Heat through, taste and adjust seasonings, and serve, topped with a poached egg if desired.

Note: To cook black rice, combine 1 part rice with 1 3/4 parts water and salt to taste in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce the heat. Simmer 30 minutes until the water has been absorbed. Remove the lid, place a dish towel over the pot, return the lid and let stand 10 minutes. A cup of dry rice will yield 3 cups of cooked rice.

Yield: Serves four to six.

Advance preparation: You can keep this for about three days in the refrigerator and reheat.

By MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN
This recipe begins as if you were making hash brown potatoes, but then you add beets and their greens and end up with a much more nutritious, and decidedly pink, dish. If you have leftovers and want to do something different with them, warm and toss this hash with a vinaigrette for a delicious potato salad.

1 pound red boiling potatoes or baby Yukon golds, cut in small dice (about 1/2 inch)
1 bunch beets, roasted, peeled and cut in small dice (about 1/2 inch)
1 generous bunch of beet greens, stemmed and cleaned in 2 changes of water
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
Salt and freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon vinegar  sherry, red wine or Champagne (optional)
Poached eggs, if desired, for serving (optional)

1. Place the diced potatoes in a steamer above an inch of boiling water. Cover and steam for 10 minutes. Add the beet greens to the steamer, and steam for five minutes until wilted; turn them halfway through so they cook evenly. Turn off the heat underneath the steamer. With tongs, remove the greens to a bowl, and rinse them with cold water. Drain, squeeze out excess water and chop. Set the potatoes aside.

2. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large, heavy nonstick skillet. Add the potatoes, turn the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring from time to time, until the potatoes are lightly browned, about five minutes. Stir in the garlic, beets, greens, thyme, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, for another five minutes, pressing the mixture down into the pan so the edges brown. Taste, and adjust salt and pepper. Stir in the vinegar if using. Serve, topped with a poached egg if desired.

Yield: Serves four to six.

Advance preparation: This will keep for three or four days in the refrigerator, and it reheats well.

Variation: You can add a finely chopped onion to this dish to make it more like a traditional hash. Cook for about five minutes in the oil, until tender, before adding the potatoes in Step 2.

WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:
To devise a properly chewy brownie recipe, we first had to discover the perfect ratio of oil to butter. We then combated greasiness by replacing some of the oil with egg yolks, whose emulsifiers prevent fat from separating and leaking out duri...(more)

For the chewiest texture, it is important to let the brownies cool thoroughly before cutting. If your baking dish is glass, cool the brownies 10 minutes, then remove them promptly from the pan (otherwise, the superior heat retention of glass can lead to overbaking). While any high-quality chocolate can be used in this recipe, our preferred brands of bittersweet chocolate are Callebaut Intense Dark Chocolate L-60-40NV and Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar. Our preferred brand of unsweetened chocolate is Scharffen Berger. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.


INGREDIENTS
1/3cup Dutch-processed cocoa
1 1/2teaspoons instant espresso (optional)
1/2cup plus 2 tablespoons boiling water
2ounces unsweetened chocolate , finely chopped (see note and related illustration)
4tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter , melted
1/2cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2large eggs
2 large egg yolks
2teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2cups (17 1/2 ounces) sugar
1 3/4cups (8 3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4teaspoon table salt
6ounces bittersweet chocolate , cut into 1/2-inch pieces (see note)

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Referring to directions in Making a Foil Sling (related), make sling using the following steps: Cut 18-inch length foil and fold lengthwise to 8-inch width.

The cooking times here yield medium-rare steaks. Because the sauce is so rich, we think three steaks (the maximum you can fit comfortably in a large skillet) will feed four people when sliced thin.

3	tablespoons  vegetable oil 
2	large red onions , peeled and cut into 1/2-inch rounds, rings separated
3	boneless strip steaks (8- to 10-ounce), 1 to 1 1/4 inches thick
3	cloves  garlic , minced
1/2	cup  balsamic vinegar plus 1 additional tablespoon
1	teaspoon  minced fresh rosemary 
1	tablespoon  light brown sugar

 
1. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer onions to bowl. Wipe out skillet with paper towels.

2. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet and cook over medium-high heat until just smoking. Meanwhile, pat steaks dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Cook steaks, without moving, until browned on first side, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip steaks and continue to cook until browned on second side, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer steaks to plate and wrap with foil.

3. Discard fat in skillet, return onions to pan, and set over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 1/2 cup vinegar, rosemary, and brown sugar and cook, scraping up browned bits with wooden spoon, until thick and syrupy, about 2 minutes. Pour any accumulated steak juices into pan along with remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.

WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:
For a stovetop chicken recipe with crisp, golden skin, evenly cooked meat, and a flavorful sauce, we found that searing the chicken, steaming it, and then searing it again gave us the result we were looking for. Once our chicken was cooked and its skin browned, we could use the pan drippings to make our sauce.

A whole 4-pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces, can be used instead of the chicken parts. Use a splatter screen when browning the chicken.


INGREDIENTS
Chicken
3 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts (breasts, thighs, and drumsticks, or a mix, with breasts cut in half), trimmed of excess fat (see note)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 - 1 1/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
Lemon-Herb Sauce
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 medium shallot , minced (about 3 tablespoons)
1 teaspoon unbleached all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves
1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh chives
1 tablespoon cold unsalted butter

INSTRUCTIONS
1. FOR THE CHICKEN: Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken pieces skin-side down and cook without moving until golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes.

2. Using tongs, flip chicken pieces skin-side up. Reduce heat to medium-low, add 3/4 cup broth to skillet, cover, and cook until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken registers 155 degrees for breasts and 170 degrees for legs and thighs, 10 to 16 minutes (smaller pieces may cook faster than larger pieces). Transfer chicken to plate, skin-side up.

3. Pour off liquid from skillet into 2-cup measuring cup and reserve. Using tongs, wipe skillet with paper towels. Add remaining teaspoon oil to skillet and heat over medium-high heat until oil is shimmering. Return chicken pieces skin-side down and cook undisturbed until skin is deep golden brown and crisp and it reaches 160 degrees for breasts and 175 degrees for legs and thighs, 4 to 7 minutes. Transfer to serving platter and tent loosely with foil. Using spoon, skim fat from reserved cooking liquid and add enough broth to measure 3/4 cup.

4. FOR THE SAUCE: Heat oil in now-empty skillet over low heat. Add shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 1 minute. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds. Increase heat to medium-high, add reserved cooking liquid, and bring to simmer, scraping skillet bottom with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Simmer rapidly until reduced to 1/2 cup, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in any accumulated juices from resting chicken; return to simmer and cook 30 seconds. Off heat, whisk in lemon juice, parsley, chives, and butter; season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce around chicken and serve immediately.$$,1,@cat4,@subcat9,PARSEDATETIME('2011-04-26', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Serves 6 to 8

The dough should be sticky, but if you find that it's too wet and not coming together in the mixer, add 2 tablespoons more flour and mix until the dough forms a cohesive mass. Make sure to use light brown sugar in the sugar mix; dark brown sugar has a stronger molasses flavor that can be overwhelming. After baking, don't let the bread cool in the pan for more than 5 minutes or it will stick to the pan and come out in pieces. Monkey Bread is at its best when served warm.


For the Dough
2	tablespoons  unsalted butter , softened, plus 2 tablespoons melted
1	cup  warm milk (about 110 degrees)
1/3	cup  warm water (about 110 degrees)
1/4	cup  granulated sugar 
1	package rapid-rise yeast or instant yeast
3 1/4	cups  all-purpose flour , plus extra for work surface
2	teaspoons  table salt 

For the Brown Sugar Coating
1	cup  packed light brown sugar 
2	teaspoons  ground cinnamon 
8	tablespoons  unsalted butter (1 stick), melted

For the Glaze
1	cup  confectioners' sugar 
2	tablespoons  milk 
For the Dough:

1. Adjust oven rack to medium-low position and heat oven to 200 degrees. When oven reaches 200 degrees, turn it off. Butter Bundt pan with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Set aside.

2. In large measuring cup, mix together milk, water, melted butter, sugar, and yeast. Mix flour and salt in standing mixer fitted with dough hook, (see below for making Monkey Bread without a mixer). Turn machine to low and slowly add milk mixture. After dough comes together, increase speed to medium and mix until dough is shiny and smooth, 6 to 7 minutes. Turn dough onto lightly floured counter and knead briefly to form smooth, round ball. Coat large bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Place dough in bowl and coat surface of dough with cooking spray. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in warm oven until dough doubles in size, 50 to 60 minutes.

For the Sugar Coating:

3. While dough is rising, mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in bowl. Place melted butter in second bowl. Set aside.

To Form the Bread:

4. Gently remove dough from bowl, and pat into rough 8-inch square. Using bench scraper or knife, cut dough into 64 pieces. (See photos 1 and 2 on page 9.)

5. Following photo 3 on page 9, roll each dough piece into a ball. Working one at a time, dip balls in melted butter, allowing excess butter to drip back into bowl. Roll in brown sugar mixture, then, following photo 4 on page 9, layer balls in Bundt pan, staggering seams where dough balls meet as you build layers.

6. Cover Bundt pan tightly with plastic wrap and place in turned-off oven until dough balls are puffy and have risen 1 to 2 inches from top of pan, 50 to 70 minutes.

7. Remove pan from oven and heat oven to 350 degrees. Unwrap pan and bake until top is deep brown and caramel begins to bubble around edges, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in pan for 5 minutes, then turn out on platter and allow to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.

For the glaze:

8. While bread cools, whisk confectioners' sugar and milk in small bowl until lumps are gone. Using whisk, drizzle glaze over warm monkey bread, letting it run over top and sides of bread. Serve warm.

Monkey Bread Without a Mixer:

In step 2, mix flour and salt in large bowl. Make well in flour, then add milk mixture to well. Using wooden spoon, stir until dough becomes shaggy and is difficult to stir. Turn out onto lightly floured work surface and begin to knead, incorporating shaggy scraps back into dough. Knead until dough is smooth and satiny, about 10 minutes. Shape into taut ball and proceed as directed.$$,1,@cat3,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2011-05-13', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

By MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN
I use a certain formula for Provençal gratins combining grains and vegetables. I cook the greens and garlic, and then toss them with a cup of cooked grains, three eggs, a half cup of milk and some Gruyère cheese. I happened to have purple barley in my freezer when trying out this recipe, but you can use any type of barley, brown rice or arborio rice.

1 generous bunch beet greens, stemmed and washed

2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

1 medium onion, chopped

4 large cloves green garlic, peeled and sliced, or one small head that has not separated into cloves, chopped

Salt to taste

1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

3 eggs

1/2 cup 2 percent milk

Freshly ground pepper

1 cup cooked barley (regular pearled or purple), brown rice or arborio rice

1/2 cup grated Gruyère cheese (2 ounces)

2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Oil a 2-quart gratin dish with olive oil. Blanch the beet greens for one minute in a large pot of generously salted boiling water, or steam over 1 inch of boiling water for two to five minutes until wilted and tender. Rinse with cold water, squeeze out water and chop medium-fine. Set aside.

2. Heat the oil over medium heat in a large, heavy skillet. Add the onion, and cook, stirring, until tender, about five minutes. Add the garlic and a generous pinch of salt. Continue to cook for another minute or two until the garlic is fragrant. Stir in the cooked greens and the thyme, and toss together. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.

3. In a large bowl, beat together the eggs and milk. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Stir in the greens mixture, the barley or rice, and the cheeses. Mix together well. Scrape into the oiled baking dish.

4. Bake 35 to 40 minutes until sizzling and lightly browned on the top and sides. Remove from the heat, and allow to sit for at least 10 minutes before serving.

Yield: Serves four to six.

Advance preparation: The gratin will be good for three or four days. It is as good served cold or at room temperature as it is hot.

From the episode: The Italian Grill

Serves 4

For the best flavor, use a high-quality chicken, such as Bell & Evans. Use an oven mitt or dish towel to safely grip and maneuver the hot bricks. If youre using table salt, reduce the amount to 1½ teaspoons in step 2. You will need two standard-sized bricks for this recipe. Placing the bricks on the chicken while it cooks ensures that the skin will be evenly browned and well rendereddont skip this step. A cast-iron skillet or other heavy pan can be used in place of the bricks.

INGREDIENTS
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
8 medium garlic cloves , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 1/2 tablespoons)
1 teaspoon finely grated zest from 1 lemon , plus 2 tablespoons juice
  Pinch crushed red pepper flakes
4 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves
3 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
  Kosher salt (see note)
  Ground black pepper
1 (3 3/4- to 4 1/4-pound) whole chicken (see note)
  Vegetable oil for cooking grate

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Combine oil, garlic, lemon zest, and pepper flakes in small saucepan. Bring to simmer, stirring frequently, over medium-low heat, about 3 minutes. Once simmering, add 3 teaspoons thyme and 2 teaspoons rosemary and cook 30 seconds longer. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over small bowl, pushing on solids to extract oil. Transfer solids to small bowl and cool; set oil and solids aside.

2. Butterfly chicken, flatten breastbone, and tuck wings behind back. Using hands or handle of wooden spoon, loosen skin over breast and thighs and remove any excess fat. Combine 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in small bowl. Mix 3 teaspoons salt mixture with cooled garlic solids. Spread salt-garlic mixture evenly under skin over chicken breast and thighs. Sprinkle remaining teaspoon salt mixture on exposed meat of bone side. Place chicken skin-side up on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.

3. Wrap 2 bricks tightly in aluminum foil. Light large chimney starter filled three-quarters with charcoal (4½ quarts, or about 75 briquettes) and burn until coals are covered with layer of fine gray ash, about 20 minutes. Build modified two-level fire by arranging all coals over half of grill, leaving other half empty. Position cooking grate over coals, place bricks on grate over coals, cover grill, and heat about 5 minutes. Scrape cooking grate clean with grill brush. Lightly dip wad of paper towels in vegetable oil; holding wad with tongs, wipe cooking grate. Grill is ready when side with coals is medium-hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above grate for 3 to 4 seconds).

4. Place chicken skin-side down over cooler side of grill with legs facing fire, place hot bricks lengthwise over each breast half, cover grill, and cook until skin is lightly browned and faint grill marks appear, 22 to 25 minutes. Remove bricks from chicken. Using tongs or towel, grip legs and flip chicken (chicken should release freely from grill; use thin metal spatula to loosen if stuck) and transfer to hot side of grill, skin-side up, with breast facing center of grill. Place bricks over breast, cover grill, and cook until chicken is well browned, 12 to 15 minutes.

5. Remove bricks, flip chicken skin-side down over hot coals, and cook until chicken skin is well crisped and instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes, moving chicken as necessary to prevent flare-ups. Transfer chicken to cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Whisk lemon juice and remaining thyme and rosemary into reserved oil; season with salt and pepper.

Quinoa lends itself to lemony salads, and the rainbow mix is particularly nice because each type of quinoa has a slightly different texture. The pearl white grains are the fluffiest, the red and black more compact.

1 cup rainbow quinoa (a mixture of equal parts white, red and black quinoa)

3 cups water

Salt to taste

1/2 cup fresh lemon juice

1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

1 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley

1/4 cup finely chopped fresh mint

1 bunch scallions, white part and green, finely chopped

1 red bell pepper, chopped

1 cup finely diced cucumber

Small leaves romaine lettuce, for garnish

In summer: 1 pound ripe tomatoes, cut in small dice

1. Rinse the quinoa thoroughly, and combine with the water and salt to taste in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer 15 to 20 minutes until the quinoa displays a little white spiral. Drain through a strainer, tap to remove excess water, then return the quinoa to the pot. Place a dish towel over the top of the pot, and return the lid. Let sit for 15 minutes. The quinoa should now be fluffy.

2. Transfer the quinoa to a large bowl. Mix together the lemon juice, salt to taste and cumin, and toss half of it with the quinoa. Allow the quinoa to cool. Combine the remaining lemon juice and olive oil, and toss with the cooled quinoa. Add the remaining ingredients, except the lettuce leaves, and toss together. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve on a large platter or in a wide salad bowl, garnished with the lettuce leaves.

Yield: Serves four to six.

Advance preparation: The cooked quinoa will keep for four days in the refrigerator. You can make the salad several hours ahead and refrigerate.

INSERT INTO RECIPE (ID, TITLE, BODY, OWNER_ID, CATEGORY_ID, SUB_CATEGORY_ID, DATE_CREATED, VERSION) VALUES (seq_recipe.nextval, $$Steak Tacos$$, $$Serves 4 to 6.   Published September 1, 2008.   From Cook's Illustrated.

WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:
To develop a steak taco recipe with an indoor cooking method that yielded steak taco meat as tender, juicy, and rich-tasting as the grilled method, we chose flank steak, beefy and tender when sliced thinly across the grain. Pan-searing gave us the browned exterior and crisp, brittle edges characteristic of grilled meat. A paste of oil, cilantro, scallions, garlic, and jalapeño applied to the meat and scraped off just before cooking gave our steak taco recipe a flavor boost without sacrificing browning.

For a less spicy dish, remove some or all of the ribs and seeds from the jalapeños before chopping them for the marinade. In addition to the toppings suggested below, try serving the tacos with Sweet and Spicy Pickled Onions, thinly sliced radishes or cucumber, or salsa.


INGREDIENTS
Herb Paste
1/2 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves
3 medium garlic cloves , roughly chopped
3 medium scallions , roughly chopped (about 1/3 cup)
1 medium jalapeño chile , stemmed and roughly chopped (see note)
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice

Steak
1 flank steak (1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds), trimmed of excess fat and cut lengthwise (with grain) into 4 equal pieces (see below)
1 tablespoon kosher salt or 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Tacos

12 (6-inch) corn tortillas , warmed (see note)
Fresh cilantro leaves
Minced white or red onion
Lime wedges

INSTRUCTIONS
1. FOR THE HERB PASTE: Pulse cilantro, garlic, scallions, jalapeño, and cumin in food processor until finely chopped, ten to twelve 1-second pulses, scraping down sides as necessary. Add oil and process until mixture is smooth and resembles pesto, about 15 seconds, scraping down sides of workbowl as necessary. Transfer 2 tablespoons herb paste to medium bowl; whisk in lime juice and set aside.

2. FOR THE STEAK: Using dinner fork, poke each piece of steak 10 to 12 times on each side. Place in large baking dish; rub all sides of steak pieces evenly with salt and then coat with remaining herb paste. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.

3. Scrape herb paste off steak and sprinkle all sides of pieces evenly with sugar and pepper. Heat oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until smoking. Place steak in skillet and cook until well browned, about 3 minutes. Flip steak and sear until second side is well browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Using tongs, stand each piece on a cut side and cook, turning as necessary, until all cut sides are well browned and internal temperature registers 125 to 130 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 2 to 7 minutes. Transfer steak to cutting board and let rest 5 minutes.

4. FOR THE TACOS: Using sharp chefs knife or carving knife, slice steak pieces across grain into 1/8-inch-thick pieces. Transfer sliced steak to bowl with herb paste-lime juice mixture and toss to coat. Season with salt. Spoon small amount of sliced steak into center of each warm tortilla and serve immediately, passing toppings separately.

SHOPPING
Corn Tortillas for Tacos

The rule of thumb when buying tortillas is to buy a brand made with nothing more than ground corn treated with lime (an alkali that removes the germ and hull) and water. Look for brands sold in the refrigerator case of the supermarket, as these have few, if any, preservatives and tend to be more moist and flavorful.$$,1,@cat4,@subcat1,PARSEDATETIME('2011-09-24', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

By MARK BITTMAN
(Adapted from the Rose Garden restaurant, Anthony, Tex.)

Time: About 1 1/2 hours

2 1/2 pounds bone-in chicken thighs or legs
1 pound beef bones, or a cut of beef with a lot of bone in it (like short ribs), optional
1 medium onion, quartered (leave the skin on)
1 head garlic, halved across the equator (leave the skin on)
1/4 cup vegetable oil, or more as needed
6 corn tortillas
Salt
2 tablespoons canned chipotle chilies in adobo, or to taste
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 avocados, pitted, peeled and cubed
4 to 8 ounces plain melting cheese, like mozzarella (not fresh), Oaxaca or Jack, shredded or cubed

Lime wedges for serving, optional.

1. Put the chicken, the beef bones if youre using them, 3 of the onion quarters and the garlic in a large pot. Add water just to cover (about 10 cups) and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat so the liquid bubbles gently. Cook, skimming the foam off the surface every now and then, until the chicken is very tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

2. Meanwhile, put the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, fry 2 of the tortillas (one at a time if necessary), turning once, until crisp and golden, 2 to 3 minutes per tortilla. Drain on paper towels. Cut the 4 remaining tortillas into strips, add them to the skillet and fry, stirring to separate them, until crisp and golden, another 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt while theyre still warm.

3. When the chicken is tender, transfer it to a plate or cutting board with tongs or a slotted spoon (or put it in the fridge or freezer so it cools faster). When its cool enough to handle, shred the meat with your fingers, discarding the bones and the skin. (If you used beef, discard it or save it for another use.)

4. While the chicken is cooling, strain the stock and discard the solids. Peel the remaining quarter of an onion and put it in a blender with the chipotle, 1/4 cup of the cilantro and a sprinkle of salt. Crumble in the two whole fried tortillas and add enough stock to fill the blender a little more than halfway. Purée until the mixture is as smooth as possible.

5. Pour the purée and remaining stock back into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat so the mixture bubbles gently and cook for 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the shredded chicken, taste and add more salt if necessary. Divide the avocados, the cheese and the remaining 1/4 cup cilantro among 4 to 6 bowls. Ladle the soup into the bowls and garnish with the fried tortilla strips. Serve immediately with lime wedges if you like.

Add the onion and a sprinkle of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until it softens slightly, 4 to 5 minutes.

2. Add the garlic, tomatoes and 1 cup water, not quite enough to cover the mixture. Bring to a boil, and let it boil vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chilies, a sprinkle of salt and a sprinkle of garlic powder if youre using it. Reduce the heat so the mixture bubbles gently but steadily, and cover partly. Cook until most of the liquid evaporates, 6 to 10 minutes (there should be some juices left in the bottom of the pot, but the mixture shouldnt be soupy). Taste, add a little more salt if necessary and serve with warm flour tortillas or over rice.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

Makes: 4 servings

Time: 25 minutes

Quickly cooking the cumin, coriander, and cinnamon in the warm dressing concentrates their flavors and helps them soak into the cauliflower (the fragrance is amazing). This is one of those uncommon salads that benefits from refrigerating for a day, but its best served at room temperature.

Salt
1 large cauliflower, cored
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 small red onion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon coriander
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
Black pepper
Juice of 1 lemon
Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it; set up a bowl of ice water. Add the cauliflower to the boiling water and cook until you can just barely pierce the center with a skewer or thin-bladed knife (you want it still quite crisp), 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the cauliflower, plunge it in the ice water, and let cool for a few minutes. Drain the cauliflower well and roughly chop.

2. Dump the cooking water, put the oil in the same pot, and turn the heat to medium. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring once or twice, until they are no longer raw. Stir in the cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Stir in the lemon juice and turn off the heat.

3. Toss the cauliflower with the warm dressing in the pot. Taste, adjust the seasoning if necessary, and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately. (Or wait to add the parsley, refrigerate for up to a day or 2, bring the salad back to room temperature, and toss with the parsley right before serving.)$$,1,@cat6,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2011-10-18', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:
To devise a properly chewy brownie recipe, we first had to discover the perfect ratio of oil to butter. We then combated greasiness by replacing some of the oil with egg yolks, whose emulsifiers prevent fat from separating and leaking out during baking. We found that unsweetened chocolate provides the strongest chocolate flavor. Finally, folding in bittersweet chocolate chunks just before baking gave our chewy brownies gooey pockets of melted chocolate and rounded out their complex flavor.

For the chewiest texture, it is important to let the brownies cool thoroughly before cutting. If your baking dish is glass, cool the brownies 10 minutes, then remove them promptly from the pan (otherwise, the superior heat retention of glass can lead to overbaking). While any high-quality chocolate can be used in this recipe, our preferred brands of bittersweet chocolate are Callebaut Intense Dark Chocolate L-60-40NV and Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar. Our preferred brand of unsweetened chocolate is Scharffen Berger. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.

INGREDIENTS
1/3 cup Dutch-processed cocoa
1 1/2 teaspoons instant espresso (optional)
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons boiling water
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate , finely chopped (see note)
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter , melted
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 large eggs
2 large egg yolks
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups (17 1/2 ounces) sugar
1 3/4 cups (8 3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon table salt
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate , cut into 1/2-inch pieces (see note)

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Referring to directions in Making a Foil Sling (related), make sling using the following steps: Cut 18-inch length foil and fold lengthwise to 8-inch width. Fit foil into length of 13 by 9-inch baking pan, pushing it into corners and up sides of pan; allow excess to overhang pan edges. Cut 14-inch length foil and fit into width of pan in the same manner, perpendicular to the first sheet (if using extra-wide foil, fold second sheet lengthwise to 12-inch width). Spray with nonstick cooking spray.

2. Whisk cocoa, espresso powder (if using), and boiling water together in large bowl until smooth. Add unsweetened chocolate and whisk until chocolate is melted. Whisk in melted butter and oil. (Mixture may look curdled.) Add eggs, yolks, and vanilla and continue to whisk until smooth and homogeneous. Whisk in sugar until fully incorporated. Add flour and salt and mix with rubber spatula until combined. Fold in bittersweet chocolate pieces.

3. Scrape batter into prepared pan and bake until toothpick inserted halfway between edge and center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack and cool 1½ hours.

4. Using foil overhang, lift brownies from pan. Return brownies to wire rack and let cool completely, about 1 hour. Cut into 2-inch squares and serve.$$,1,@cat3,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2011-10-29', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Time: 31/2 hours

1 whole chicken (3 1/2 pounds), rinsed and patted dry
1 pound beef short ribs, rinsed and patted dry
2 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning
1 large white onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 bunches cilantro, with roots if possible
2 russet potatoes, peeled and coarsely grated (about 4 cups)
1 1/4 pounds small Yukon Gold or red potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
2 large ears of corn, husked and cut into 1-inch rounds
3 medium tomatoes, cored and chopped
3/4 cup finely chopped scallion
3/4 cup finely chopped shallots
1 habanero pepper, plus more to taste
5 cups fresh baby spinach
1/2 cup capers with brine
1 teaspoon black pepper
3 avocadoes, peeled, pitted and diced, for serving
Sour cream, for serving.

1. Season the chicken and beef all over with salt. Let stand 15 minutes. In a large pot, combine the chicken, beef, onion, dried oregano and 2 teaspoons salt. Rinse away any grit from the cilantro (do not trim), tie one bunch with kitchen twine and drop it into the pot. Pour in enough cold water to just cover the meat (about 12 cups). Simmer until the chicken is just cooked through, about 40 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a large platter and let cool.

2. Stir in the grated potato. Continue to simmer until the beef is meltingly tender and the potatoes have melted into the broth, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer the meat to a platter. Once cool enough to handle, shred the beef and chicken, and discard the bones, skin, fat and gristle.

3. Stir the chopped potato and corn into the pot. Simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.

4. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the tomatoes, scallions, shallots and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Chop 1/3 cup of cilantro leaves from the remaining bunch and stir into this salsa. Wearing gloves, remove and discard the seeds from the habanero; finely chop and add to the salsa.

5. Before serving the stew, return the chicken and beef to the pot. Stir in the spinach, capers and black pepper. Cook until the meat is warmed through and spinach is wilted. Ladle into bowls. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Top each serving with salsa, avocado and a dollop of sour cream.

Yield 8 servings

Time About 1 hour, plus 1 hour's refrigeration


1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
Pinch salt
3 tablespoons sugar
9 tablespoons cold butter
1 egg yolk
3 or 4 medium apples, preferably Golden Delicious, or pears, peeled, cored and very thinly sliced
2 tablespoons brown sugar
Crème fraîche, sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.


1. Combine flour, salt and sugar in a food processor; pulse once or twice. Cut 8 tablespoons butter into chunks, and add it and egg yolk to flour mixture. Process until butter is blended, about 10 seconds. Turn mixture into a bowl, and add cold water, a tablespoon at a time, stirring after each addition. After adding 3 or 4 tablespoons you should be able to gather mixture into a ball; wrap ball in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or freeze for about 15 minutes).

2. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Roll or pat dough into a 10-inch circle; it can be quite crude in shape. Place it on a cookie or pizza sheet lined with parchment. Arrange fruit slices on top, right out to edges; make the pattern attractive, if you like. Sprinkle with brown sugar. Cut remaining butter into bits, and top fruit with it.

3. Bake until crust is nicely browned and fruit is tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove, and serve warm or at room temperature, with crème fraîche, whipped cream or ice cream.$$,1,@cat3,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2011-10-31', 'yyyy-MM-dd'),0);
