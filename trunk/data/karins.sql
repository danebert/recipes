As soon as the water simmers, it produces steam, the nemesis of melting chocolate. If even a droplet of moisture gets into the chocolate, it can seize or stiffen. If this happens, start over with new chocolate. Mixing the melted chocolate with vegetable oil causes the formation of small slivers of chocolate in the finished ice cream. This method, perfected by noted cookbook author Nick Malgieri, yields a distinctive and well-blended ice cream. \r<BR> \r<BR>1 1&#8260;2 cups milk\r<BR>1 1&#8260;2 cups heavy cream\r<BR>1 cup packed fresh mint leaves\r<BR>4 egg yolks\r<BR>1&#8260;2 cup plus 2 Tbs. sugar\r<BR>Pinch of salt\r<BR>1 or 2 drops green food coloring (optional)\r<BR>1 or 2 drops blue food coloring (optional) \r<BR>3 oz. bittersweet or semisweet chocolate,\r<BR>  finely chopped\r<BR>2 tsp. canola oil \r<BR>\r<BR>In a heavy 2-quart saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk, 1 cup of the cream and the mint leaves.

Gradually whisk about 1&#8260;2 cup of the warm milk mixture into the egg mixture until smooth. Pour the egg mixture back into the pan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon and keeping the custard at a low simmer, until it is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon and leaves a clear trail when a finger is drawn through it, 4 to 6 minutes. Do not allow the custard to boil. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing on the mint with the back of the spoon. Stir in the food colorings. \r<BR>\r<BR>Place the bowl in a larger bowl partially filled with ice water, stirring occasionally until cool. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 3 hours or up to 24 hours. \r<BR>\r<BR>About 1 hour before freezing the ice cream, in the top of a double boiler over barely simmering water, melt the chocolate, stirring until it is melted.

FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9-inch-round by 2-inch-high cake pans with softened butter; dust pans with flour and knock out excess. Combine chocolate, cocoa powder, and hot water in medium heatproof bowl; set bowl over saucepan containing 1 inch of simmering water and stir with rubber spatula until chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup sugar to chocolate mixture and stir until thick and glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove bowl from heat and set aside to cool. \r<BR>\r<BR>2. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. Combine buttermilk and vanilla in small bowl. In bowl of standing mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whisk eggs and yolks on medium-low speed until combined, about 10 seconds. Add remaining 1 1/4 cups sugar, increase speed to high, and whisk until fluffy and lightened in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Replace whisk with paddle attachment. Add cooled chocolate mixture to egg/sugar mixture and mix on medium speed until thoroughly incorporated, 30 to 45 seconds, pausing to scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula as needed. Add softened butter one tablespoon at a time, mixing about 10 seconds after each addition. Add about one-third of flour mixture followed by half of buttermilk mixture, mixing until incorporated after each addition (about 15 seconds). Repeat using half of remaining flour mixture and all of remaining buttermilk mixture (batter may appear separated). Scrape down sides of bowl and add remaining flour mixture; mix at medium-low speed until batter is thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Remove bowl from mixer and fold batter once or twice with rubber spatula to incorporate any remaining flour. Divide batter evenly between prepared cake pans; smooth batter to edges of pan with spatula.\r<BR>\r<BR>3.

Meanwhile, heat butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat until melted. Increase heat to medium; add sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, and salt and stir with heatproof rubber spatula until sugar is dissolved, 4 to 5 minutes. Add melted chocolate, butter mixture, and cream to clean bowl of standing mixer and stir to thoroughly combine. \r<BR>\r<BR>5. Place mixer bowl over ice bath and stir mixture constantly with rubber spatula until frosting is thick and just beginning to harden against sides of bowl, 1 to 2 minutes (frosting should be 70 degrees).

For efficiency, you can prepare the soup ingredients while the beans simmer and the garnishes while the soup simmers. Though you do not need to offer all of the garnishes listed below, do choose at least a couple; garnishes are essential for this soup as they add not only flavor but texture and color as well. Leftover soup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 or 4 days; reheat it in a saucepan over medium heat until hot, stirring in additional chicken broth if it has thickened beyond your liking. The addition of chipotle chiles in adobo--smoked jalapeños packed in a seasoned tomato-vinegar sauce--makes this a spicier, smokier variation on Black Bean Soup.\r\n\r\nMakes about 9 Cups, Serving 6\r\n\r\nBeans\r\n \r\n1 pound dried black beans (2 cups), rinsed and picked over  \r\n4 ounces ham steak , trimmed of rind  \r\n2 bay leaves   \r\n5 cups water   \r\n1/8 teaspoon baking soda   \r\n1 teaspoon table salt   \r\n\r\nSoup\r\n \r\n3 tablespoons olive oil   \r\n2 large onions , chopped fine (about 3 cups)  \r\n1 large carrot , chopped fine (about 1/2 cup)  \r\n3 ribs celery , chopped fine (about 1 cup)  \r\n1/2 teaspoon table salt   \r\n5 - 6 medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 1/2 tablespoon)  \r\n1 1/2 tablespoons ground cumin   \r\n1 tablespoon minced chipotle chiles in adobo   \r\n2 teaspoons adobo sauce   \r\n6 cups low-sodium chicken broth   \r\n2 tablespoons cornstarch   \r\n2 tablespoon water   \r\n2 tablespoons lime juice , from 1 to 2 limes  \r\n\r\nGarnishes\r\n \r\n lime wedges   \r\n minced fresh cilantro leaves   \r\n red onion , finely diced  \r\n avocado , diced medium  \r\n sour cream   \r\n\r\n\r\n1. FOR THE BEANS: Place beans, ham, bay, water, and baking soda in large saucepan with tight-fitting lid. Bring to boil over medium-high heat; using large spoon, skim scum as it rises to surface. Stir in salt, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer briskly until beans are tender, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours (if necessary, add another 1 cup water and continue to simmer until beans are tender); do not drain beans. Discard bay. Remove ham steak (ham steak darkens to color of beans), cut into 1/4-inch cubes, and set aside.\r\n\r\n2. FOR THE SOUP: Heat oil in 8-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking; add onions, carrot, celery, and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft and lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and add garlic and cumin; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir in beans, bean cooking liquid, chipotle chiles, adobo sauce, and chicken broth. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, to blend flavors, about 30 minutes. \r\n\r\n3. TO FINISH THE SOUP: Ladle 1 1?2 cups beans and 2 cups liquid into food processor or blender, process until smooth, and return to pot. Stir together cornstarch and water in small bowl until combined, then gradually stir about half of cornstarch mixture into soup; bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, to fully thicken. If soup is still thinner than desired once boiling, stir remaining cornstarch mixture to recombine and gradually stir mixture into soup; return to boil to fully thicken. Off heat, stir in lime juice and reserved ham; ladle soup into bowls and serve immediately, passing garnishes separately.',2,@cat4,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2007-09-24','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Serve this cake as is or dress it up with lightly sweetened berries. The cake has a light, fluffy texture when eaten the day it is baked, but if well wrapped and held at room temperature overnight its texture becomes more dense -- like that of pound cake -- the following day. \r\n\r\nServes 12 to 14\r\n\r\nCake\r\n \r\n3 lemons , zest grated and saved, then juiced for 3 tablespoons juice (see note above)  \r\n3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (15 ounces)  \r\n1 teaspoon baking powder   \r\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda   \r\n1 teaspoon table salt   \r\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract   \r\n3/4 cup low-fat buttermilk (preferably)  \r\n3 large eggs , at room temperature  \r\n1 large egg yolk , at room temperature  \r\n18 tablespoons unsalted butter (2 1/4 sticks), at room temperature  \r\n2 cups sugar (14 ounces)  \r\n\r\nGlaze\r\n \r\n2–3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (see note above)  \r\n1 tablespoon buttermilk   \r\n2 cups confectioners\' sugar (8 ounces)  \r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Reduce to low speed; add about one-third of flour mixture, followed by half of buttermilk mixture, mixing until just incorporated after each addition (about 5 seconds). Repeat using half of remaining flour mixture and all of remaining buttermilk mixture. Scrape bowl and add remaining flour mixture; mix at medium-low speed until batter is thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Remove bowl from mixer and fold batter once or twice with rubber spatula to incorporate any remaining flour. Scrape into prepared pan.\r\n\r\n3. Bake until top is golden brown and wooden skewer or toothpick inserted into center comes out with no crumbs attached, 45 to 50 minutes. \r\n\r\n4. FOR THE GLAZE: While cake is baking, whisk 2 tablespoons lemon juice, buttermilk, and confectioners\' sugar until smooth, adding more lemon juice gradually as needed until glaze is thick but still pourable (mixture should leave faint trail across bottom of mixing bowl when drizzled from whisk). Cool cake in pan on wire rack set over baking sheet for 10 minutes, then invert cake directly onto rack.

Marinate the meat. In a food processor or blender, combine 1/4 of the onion, the garlic, lime juice, cumin and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Process to a smooth puree. Place the skirt steak in a non-aluminum baking dish. Using a spoon, smear the marinade over both sides of the skirt steak. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour or up to 8 hours.\r\n\r\n2. Caramelize the onions. Heat a gas grill to medium-high or light a charcoal fire and let it burn just until the coals are covered with gray ash. Either turn the burner(s) in the center of the grill to medium-low or bank the coals to one side of the grill for indirect cooking.\r\n\r\nBrush or spray the remaining onion slices with oil and sprinkle with salt. Lay the whole rounds of onions on the grill, not over direct heat. When they start to soften and brown, about 10 minutes, use a spatula to flip them and brown the other side.

Oil the steak well on both sides, and lay it over the hottest part of the grill or directly over the coals. Grill, turning once, until richly browned and done to your liking, about 2-3 minutes per side for medium.

Pour in the hot water, and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon (or with the flat paddle attachment of the electric mixer at low speed) and beat for about 2 minutes. \r\n\r\nAdd the remaining half-cup of flour, a little at a time, stirring by hand. When the batter becomes thick and heavy, attach the mixer’s dough hook (if using) or lift the dough from the bowl and place it on a lightly floured work surface for kneading by hand. \r\n\r\nKnead the dough: Knead the dough at medium low speed on the mixer – or by hand (using a push, turn and fold motion, energetically) for about 10 minutes – or until the dough is firm and solid when pinched with the fingers. Add flour as needed if the dough is sticky in your hands, or sticks to the sides of the mixing bowl (if using electric mixer). \r\n\r\nFirst Rising: When dough is kneaded enough, place it in an oiled mixing bowl, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside at room temperature until it has doubled in volume – about 1 hour. \r\n\r\nPrepare water bath: Near the end of this rising time, bring the 3 quarts of water to the boil in a large saucepan. Add the malt syrup or sugar; then, reduce the heat and leave the water just barely moving – at a slow simmer. \r\n\r\nShape the bagels: When the dough has doubled in volume, turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface and punch it down with extended fingers to remove excess gas. \r\n\r\nDivide the dough into 10 pieces (each will weigh about 3-4 ounces). Shape each piece into a ball. Allow the balls to stand and relax for a few minutes – then flatten each one with the palm of your hand. \r\n\r\nWith your thumb, press deep into the center of the bagel and tear the depression open with your fingers. Pull the hole open, pull it down over a finger and smooth the rough edges. It should look like a bagel! Form all of the bagels and place them on your work surface. \r\n\r\nSecond Rising: Cover the shaped bagels with wax paper or parchment paper. Leave them at room temperature just until the dough has risen slightly – about 10 minutes (this is called a “half proof”). [Cook’s Note: If the bagels are allowed to rise too much during this “second rise” – they will not sink when put in the simmering water; but, if that should happen, just pretend that they DID sink – and cook them for the same 1 minute as described below. The difference will be unnoticeable to most anyone.] \r\n\r\nPrepare the baking sheet: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. [Cook’s Note: If using a convection oven, reduce the heat by 50 degrees.] Grease a baking sheet with shortening (or use a non-stick baking sheet, or line a baking sheet with “Silpat” or similar material) and sprinkle the baking sheet with cornmeal. \r\n\r\nWater-bathing the bagels: Into the gently simmering water prepared earlier, slip one bagel at a time (use a large skimmer, and gently lower them into the water). Simmer only 2 or 3 bagels at a time – do not crowd the pan. The bagels will sink and then rise again after a few seconds. Simmer gently for one minute, turning each bagel over once during that time. Lift each bagel out of the water with the skimmer, drain briefly on a towel, then place each bagel on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all bagels are simmered, drained and on the baking sheet. [Cook’s Note: Thanks to the malt syrup or the sugar that was added to the simmering water, the bagels will be shiny as they come from the water.] \r\n\r\nBaking the bagels: If toppings are desired, (see “Variations” below) now is the time to add them, by sprinkling the desired topping over the bagels. Brush each bagel lightly with the egg-white-water mixture first, then sprinkle the topping if desired – or leave unadorned, for water bagels. \r\n\r\nPlace the baking sheet on the middle rack of the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes. When the bagel tops are a light brown, turn them over to complete baking. This turning-over step will keep the bagels in a rounded shape, instead of their being flat on the bottom. When brown and shiny, remove the finished bagels from the oven. \r\nPlace the bagels on a metal rack to cool.\r\n\r\n \r\nVariations:\r\nToppings may include: coarse salt, shredded onion, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, or other flavors of your choice. Sprinkle toppings over before baking bagels, as described above. \r\n\r\nAnother tasty treat: slice each bagel crosswise into 4 thin rounds. Return the rounds to the oven and bake the rounds until dry throughout, and just beginning to brown – about 20 minutes. Remove the rounds from the oven, immediately butter them and salt lightly – then return to the oven for about 5 minutes until the butter is absorbed by the rounds. Serve hot or at room temperature as a snack. \r\n \r\n',2,@cat8,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2009-08-14','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Brush the surface with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.\r<BR>\r<BR>*Alternatively if you don\'t have an electric mixer: Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface; shape into a mound and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Continue as directed above.\r<BR>\r<BR>Cut the ball of dough in 1/2, cover and reserve the piece you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting. Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue tightening until the machine is at the narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick (you should be able to see your hand through it.). Dust the sheets of dough with flour as needed.\r<BR>\r<BR>Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Dust the counter and sheet of dough with flour, lay out the long sheet of pasta, and brush the top surface with the egg wash, which acts as a glue. Drop tablespoons of your favorite filling on 1/2 of the pasta sheet, about 2-inches apart. Fold the other 1/2 over the filling like a blanket. With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling. Use a sharp knife to cut each pillow into squares and crimp the 4 edges with the tins of a fork to make a tight seal. Dust the ravioli and a sheet pan with cornmeal to prevent the pasta from sticking and lay them out to dry slightly while assembling the rest.\r<BR>\r<BR>Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 4 minutes; they\'ll float to the top when ready, so be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon. Bath the ravioli in your favorite sauce to lightly coat and serve.',2,@cat1,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2009-11-23','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

INSERT INTO RECIPE (ID, TITLE, BODY, OWNER_ID, CATEGORY_ID, SUB_CATEGORY_ID, DATE_CREATED, VERSION) VALUES (seq_recipe.nextval,'Yeast information- no recipe','Can you sort out yeast label confusion? And can they be substituted for each other?\r\n\r\nDespite indications to the contrary—created by the commercial largesse of the yeast companies—there are only three types of yeast: fresh, active dry, and instant. All are derived from the powerful brewer\'s yeast known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but each is processed from a slightly different strain of this protypical yeast.\r\n\r\n\r\nTypes\r\nFresh Yeast: The original commercial yeast, known as fresh, compressed, or cake yeast is about 70 percent water by weight and is composed of 100 percent living cells. It is soft and crumbly and requires no proofing—fresh yeast will dissolve if it is simply rubbed into sugar or dropped into warm liquid. Owing to qualities associated with its strain, fresh yeast will produce the most carbon dioxide of all three types of yeasts during fermentation. Fresh yeast is considered fast, potent, and reliable, but it has a drawback: it is highly perishable and must be refrigerated and used before its expiry date.\r\n\r\nActive Dry: Active dry yeasts arrive at their granular state by undergoing processes that reduce them to 95 percent dry matter. Traditional active dry yeast is exposed to heat so high that many of its cells are destroyed in the process. Because the spent outer cells encapsulate living centers, active dry yeast must first be dissolved in a relatively hot liquid (proofed) to slough off dead cells and reach the living centers.\r\n\r\nInstant Yeasts: Also called \"Instant,\" \"Rapid Rise,\" or \"Bread\" instant yeasts are also processed to 95 percent dry matter, but are subjected to a gentler drying process than active dry. As a result, every dried particle is living, or active. This means the yeast can be mixed directly with recipe ingredients without first being dissolved in water or proofed. It is in this context that the yeast is characterized as \"instant.\" We prefer instant yeast in the test kitchen. It combines the potency of fresh yeast with the convenience of active dry, and it is considered by some to have a cleaner flavor than active dry because it contains no dead cells. (In our months of testing, we found this to be true when we made a lean baguette dough but could detect no difference in flavor when using the two yeasts in doughs made with milk, sugar, and butter.)\r\n\r\nSubstitution Formulas\r\nTo substitute active dry for instant (or rapid rise) yeast: Use 25 percent more active dry. For example, if the recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of instant yeast, use 1 1/4 teaspoons of active dry. And don\'t forget to \"prove\" the yeast, i.e. dissolving it in a portion of the water from the recipe, heated to 105 degrees. \r\n\r\nTo substitute instant (or rapid rise) yeast for active dry: Use about 25 percent less. For example if the recipe calls for 1 packet or 2 1/4 teaspoons of active dry yeast, use 1 3/4 teaspoons of instant yeast. And you do not need to prove the yeast, just add it to the dry ingredients.\r\n\r\nTo substitute fresh yeast for active dry yeast, use a ratio of roughly 2:1, i.e. use one small cake (0.6 ounce) of compressed fresh yeast in lieu of 1 packet (.25 ounces) of active dry yeast.\r\n\r\nNote a packet of active dry or instant yeast contains about 2 1/4 teaspoons (.25 ounces) of yeast.',2,@cat8,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2010-05-17','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Hopp and Camille Kingsolver\r\n\r\nThe point of this recipe is to make a large amount at one time, when tomatoes are in season. If you’re canning it, stick closely to the recipe; adding additional fresh vegetables will change the pH so it’s unsafe for water-bath canning. If you’re freezing it, then it’s fine to throw in peppers, mushrooms, fresh garlic, whatever you want. This recipe makes 6-7 quarts – you can use a combination of pint and quart canning jars or freezer boxes.\r\n\r\n10 quarts tomato puree (about 30 lbs. tomatoes) \r\n4 large onions, chopped \r\n1 cup dried basil \r\n1&#8260;2 cup honey\r\n4 tbs. dried oregano \r\n3 tbs. salt \r\n2 tbsp ground lemon peel \r\n2 tbsp. thyme \r\n2 tbs. garlic powder (or more, to taste) \r\n2tbs. dried parsley \r\n2 tsp. pepper \r\n2 tsp cinnamon \r\n1&#8260;2 tsp nutmeg\r\n\r\nSoften onions in a heavy 3-gallon kettle – add a small amount of water if necessary but no oil if you are canning (very important!). Add pureed tomatoes and all seasonings, bring to a boil, and simmer on low heat for two to three hours until sauce has thickened to your liking. Stir frequently, especially toward the end, to avoid burning. Meanwhile, heat water in canner bath, sterilize jars in boiling water or dishwasher, and pour boiling water over jar lids.\r\n\r\nAdd 2 tbsp of lemon juice OR 1&#8260;2 tsp. citric acid to each quart jar, (half that much to pint jars). This is ensures that the sauce will be safely acidic. When the sauce is ready, ladle it into the jars leaving 1&#8260;2 inch headspace. Put jars into canner and boil for 35 minutes.

Let the yeast and water sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, until the mixture has bubbled and expanded. If you\'re using instant yeast, you can skip this step.\r\n2) Combine the dissolved yeast with the remainder of the water and the rest of the ingredients. Mix and knead everything together—by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle—till you\'ve made a smooth dough. If you\'re kneading in a stand mixer, it should take about 5 to 7 minutes at second speed. In a bread machine (or by hand), it should form a smooth ball.\r\n3) Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl, and allow the dough to rise, at room temperature, till it\'s quite puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 90 minutes to 2 hours. Rising may take longer, especially if you\'ve kneaded by hand. Give it enough time to become quite puffy.\r\n4) While the dough is rising, lightly grease a 9\" x 13\" pan, or two 9\" round cake pans.\r\n5) Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface. Divide it into 16 pieces.\r\n6) Shape each piece into a rough ball by pulling the dough into a very small knot at the bottom (think of a balloon with its opening knotted), then rolling it under the palm of your hand into a smooth ball.\r\n7) Place the rolls in the 9\" x 13\" pan, or put eight rolls in each of the round cake pans, spacing them evenly; they won\'t touch one another.\r\n8) Cover the pans with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the rolls to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. They\'ll become very puffy, and will reach out and touch one another. While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 350°F.\r\n9) Bake the rolls for 15 minutes, and tent them loosely with aluminum foil. Continue to bake until they\'re mahogany-brown on top, but lighter colored on the sides, an additional 10 to 13 minutes.\r\n10) Remove the rolls from the oven, and after 2 or 3 minutes, carefully transfer them to a rack. They\'ll be hot and delicate, so be careful. Serve warm, or at room temperature.',2,@cat8,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2010-11-25','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);
