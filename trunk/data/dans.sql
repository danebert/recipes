You Could Do It in Your Sleep\nBy SAM SIFTON\n\n\nCHRIS SCHLESINGER was snoring softly on the couch. This was in the living room of his sprawling ranch house here in southeastern Massachusetts, nestled high above a pebbly beach. A Bill Murray movie was playing on the television in the corner, and the cool breeze sliding off Buzzards Bay had dampened the room, covering the warmth of the day. Outside on the sweeping deck, in a giant ovoid kettle grill, three pork butts sat in the smoky braise of a small oak fire, glistening, ruddy, plump. It was well after midnight. Seven hours\' cooking done. Seven hours to go.\n\nThe snoring came to an abrupt stop as someone in the room moved to open a sliding door and go check the fire.\n\n\"Barbecue Man may appear to be asleep,\" Mr. Schlesinger roared, climbing off the couch. \"But Barbecue Man is always awake and in control!\"\n\nHe padded barefoot to the deck and placed his palm on the covered grill. \"Barbecue is such a typical guy thing to do,\" he said. \"Much ado about nothing.\" He lifted the kettle top and a cloud of fragrant, oaky smoke engulfed him. He laughed from within it. \"But it is intense.\"\n\nMr. Schlesinger, 47, is the chef and an owner of the East Coast Grill in Cambridge, Mass., which he opened in 1985. He is also the author, with John Willoughby, of six cookbooks that relate somehow to the pleasures of fire. (Two others celebrate pickles and lettuce, respectively.)\n\nTheir latest, \"Let the Flames Begin\" (Norton), was published in 2002 and rereleased this year. There is an electric stove in his kitchen, which he rarely uses. He prefers to cook outside.\n\nThe plan was to make an American holiday meal, or at least the part that could be made on a grill, overnight, for lunchtime celebration the following day. The menu: North Carolina-style pulled pork sandwiches, with their characteristic vinegary sauce, on cheap hamburger buns. You might accompany these with a simple preparation of coleslaw or some salad and a load of cut watermelon.\n\nTo make the sandwiches, you simply pull -- or tear, really -- shreds of meat from slow-roasted shoulder of hog, which is known among butchers and barbecue aficionados as pork butt, and place these on a bun with some sauce. (A hog\'s rear quarters are called, conversely and somewhat more attractively, hams.) The cooking time for the pork may exceed 12 hours, but you could start after work tomorrow and easily be done in time for a Fourth of July lunch with little effort beyond getting up a few times in the night to tend the fire. (For those leery of sleeping while fire burns bright, the meat could be cooked throughout the day and enjoyed as a late dinner about the same time the holiday fireworks wrap up, or even refrigerated until the following day, to be reheated in the oven.)\n\nMr. Schlesinger\'s fire started slowly. About 6 p.m., he poured a pile of hardwood charcoal about the size of a large box of cereal into the front of the grill\'s firebox and added to it a generous, unapologetic spray of lighter fluid. \"I don\'t have a problem with this stuff,\" he said. \"I want to get my fire going.\" When gray ash began to appear on the edges of the charcoal, he placed on it a large piece of dry oak, which popped and crackled in the heat.\n\nMr. Schlesinger\'s grill is a Weber Ranch kettle a yard across. Behind the fire was almost two feet of open grill space, plenty for the three pork butts he planned to cook. (A conventional grill has less space, but plenty for a single butt.) The meat would cook slowly in heat that would not often, Mr. Schlesinger estimated, exceed 212 degrees. \"You want to melt the fat into the meat,\" he said. \"You don\'t want to incinerate it.\"\n\nTo protect the butts during the cooking, Mr. Schlesinger used a dry rub of spices that adhered to the pork and seized up in the heat, creating a flavorful crust. To make it, he mixed generous amounts of brown sugar, dry mustard, ground coriander, cumin, cayenne, paprika, chili pepper, freshly ground black pepper and sea salt in a bowl.\n\nWhen he was finished he set the rub aside and pulled the pork from his refrigerator.\n\n\"There\'s no extra benefit in letting this meat come to room temperature before cooking it,\" he said. \"I don\'t like to take chances with bacteria.\" He cut the butts out of their packaging with a small knife and rinsed the meat in the kitchen sink. \"Likewise,\" he explained.\n\nOutside, the charcoal fire was dying down and the oak smoking furiously. Mr. Schlesinger placed the three butts in a large disposable aluminum-foil pan on a table next to the grill and, using his hands, slathered them with the dry rub.\n\n\"It\'s O.K. if it\'s a little wet,\" he said. \"It gets pasty, and that helps spread the rub around.\"\n\nOne by one he placed the butts on the grill, fatty side down, well away from the fire. \"I\'ll turn them later,\" he said. \"In about eight hours.\" He slid the kettle top onto the grill and adjusted the top vents. Smoke rose into the air from them in a steady stream.\n\n\"It\'s running a little hot,\" Mr. Schlesinger said. \"But the one time you\'re not going to be overcooking a butt is now, at the beginning.\" He looked down at the smoke for a while, silently watching it rise.\n\n\"Let\'s get some dinner,\" he said.\n\nMr. Schlesinger checked his fire again at 9:30 p.m., adding another piece of oak, and then retreated to the living room with a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon to watch television. \"Groundhog Day,\" the 1993 movie in which Mr. Murray experiences the same day over and over, had started on TBS at 8 o\'clock. This morphed, at 10:20, into \"Ghostbusters\" (1984), in which Mr. Murray plays a parapsychology professor with a ghost-removal business. (Mr. Schlesinger added another log to the fire at 11:40.) \"Stripes,\" the 1981 movie in which an unemployed Mr. Murray joins the Army to meet girls and have a good time, got under way at 12:35 a.m. An hour later, Mr. Schlesinger reluctantly abandoned the narrative to add more charcoal to the fire, at which point he turned the butts over. More charcoal went on just after 3 a.m. On the television, \"Ghostbusters\" was playing again.\n\nBetween these chores, Mr. Schlesinger said, it only appeared that he was dozing.\n\nAt 8 a.m., with the sun beginning to dry the dew that had gathered on the deck during the night, Mr. Schlesinger declared the cooking complete, 14 hours after it had begun. \"Feel that,\" he said, pressing his finger into one of the butts. It felt like a ripe peach, or a late-summer tomato. \"Done,\" he said.\n\nWith tongs in his left hand and using his right hand for balance, moving carefully so as not to tear the skin, he pulled the butts, which now had the color and texture of redwood logs, off the grill and placed them back in the disposable aluminum-foil pan, which he had cleaned the night before.\n\n\"We\'ll let those rest,\" he said, and went to the kitchen to get the sauce: a cup of white vinegar, a cup of cider vinegar, a tablespoon of sugar and a not inconsiderable dash of Tabasco sauce, mixed together in a bowl.\n\n\"We\'ll let those butts rest all morning,\" Mr. Schlesinger continued. \"They\'ll be perfect for lunch.\"\n\nBut he soon pulled some hamburger buns out of a plastic bag and moved back to the porch. With his tongs, he picked up the largest of the butts by one end. It tore under its own weight, releasing a small cloud of steam. The smell was incomparable: sweet, smoky and fine.\n\nHe tore off a sliver of meat and tasted it, then smiled.\n\n\"I was a little nervous,\" Mr. Schlesinger said. \"You always get nervous, even when you know it\'s going to be good.\"\n\nHe pulled some more meat off the butt and placed it on a bun. Breakfast was served.\n\nChris Schlesinger is the chef and an owner of the East Coast Grill in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the author, with John Willoughby, of \"Let the Flames Begin\" (Norton).',1,@cat4,@subcat4,PARSEDATETIME('2004-02-25','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Then the pasta police declared cold pasta beneath people of good taste, and from then on cold pasta dared show its face only at bad salad bars. Of course, closet eaters of leftover pasta (I\'m one) are probably still in the majority, but that would be difficult to prove. \n\nNot all cuisines frown on eating noodles cold, however, and in Japan, where it gets plenty hot in the summer, cold soba noodles, served with a dipping sauce, are a common snack or light meal. Soba are brown noodles, made from wheat and buckwheat, and the sauce is based on dashi, the omnipresent\nJapanese stock. \n\nYou would recognize the smell of dashi in an instant, even if you have never knowingly eaten it. It\'s a brilliant concoction based on kelp, a seaweed and dried bonito flakes. It is also among the fastest and easiest stocks you can make, and its two main ingredients - which you can buy in any store specializing in Asian foods - keep indefinitely in your pantry. I would encourage you to try making it, though you can also use chicken stock (or\ninstant dashi, which is sold in the same stores). \n\nTo make dashi, immerse about a four-inch piece of kelp in two cups of water and warm over medium heat for about 10 minutes. Remove the kelp just as the water is about to boil and add a handful - about half a cup - of bonito flakes. Turn off the heat, then let the mixture sit for about two minutes. Then strain it, and that\'s your dashi. For this dish, you will want to chill the sauce, or at least cool it. \n\nAs for the noodles, the Japanese have their own method of cooking them, one in which cold water is added to the pot as the noodles cook. My guess is that this method evolved as a way to avoid overcooking, but as long as you are\nattentive, it should not be a problem. \n\nAnd one nice thing about this and other cold noodle dishes is that when you judge that the noodles are done, you stop the cooking immediately by running them under cold water. \n\nIncorrect by some standards, but delightful in this weather.',1,@cat8,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2004-02-25','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

But don\'t over cook it.\n\nThen add a can or two of diced canned tomatoes, a can or two of cooked dry beans, whatever appeals to you in way of flavor and color, a bouillon cube, some salt and pepper, basil, oregano, parsley, maybe a bit of cumin.  I usually swish the cans out with a bit of water and add that to the pot.\n\nThen put in some V-8 juice, probably enough to thin the soup out to the thickness you want.  And simmer the mess together for a short time, enough to get everyone well acquainted, but not enough to overcook anything.  Like most soups, this will probably taste better prepared one day and eaten the next.  You may want to thin it out some more with water or V-8.  I usually make it fairly concentrated for freezing and then add water when I heat it up to eat.\n\nYou can also add other vegs, zucchini, summer squash, spinach, green beans, mushrooms, those skinny little eggplants, greens, fresh or frozen or  left-over, what else sounds good?  Maybe a bit of corn, although it seems to me that corn in soups is usually sort of tough.  If appropriate you can saute your vegs with the onions, cabbage, etc.  Just don\'t overcook them.  Very tender vegs like peas and zucchini hardly need any cooking at all.\nI think the secret\" to this soup is the V-8 and the cabbage.  They contribute most of the flavor to the broth. \n\nSeth likes this served with grated parmesan cheese.  You could also throw in some cooked rice, cooked pasta (which tends to really soak up broth) or tortellini.  Or some cooked meat.  I\'ve put in leftover chicken or pot roast at times.\n\nGOOD LUCK!\n\nNOTE:\nThese proportions make roughly 7 - 8 quarts, depending on how thick you like it:\n\n1 large onion\n4-5 cloves garlic\n3-4 stalks celery\n1-2 carrots\n1 head cabbage\n1-2 cans diced tomatoes\n3-4 cans kidney beans (I like mine with lots of beans)\n\nI also like to throw in some cayanne pepper.',1,@cat9,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2004-02-25','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Just seeing pumpkins piled high in the stores fills me with harvest festival spirit. I do not have anything against a gloriously spooky Halloween pumpkin, but I\'ve always felt it was a pity to use this fruit for decoration alone.\n\nPumpkin soups there are aplenty, and I make them often at this time of year. I\'m fond of a roasted wedge in place of potatoes, too. But I knew it was possible to cook the whole pumpkin, to make a proper meal of it stuffed with rice and spices and dried fruit.\n\nI have been dying to do this for some time but thought an altogether different person  someone less clumsy  was the sort to scrape out pumpkins, stuff them and bake them. I also suspected I was too lazy for this work, but the strange truth is that the recipe here is one of the simplest you can imagine. And the result is magisterial, beautiful and inviting.\n\nThe quantity of rice specified in the recipe is what I needed for the pumpkin I stipulate, but I should say two things here. One is that you might not find (or want) a pumpkin of exactly the same weight. The other is that different pumpkins have different-size cavities. The easiest way to find out how much rice you need is as follows:\n\nWhen you have cut the top off and scraped out the seeds, take a plastic freezer bag and line the cavity with it. Pour rice into the bag to about halfway up the cavity, then pour out the rice into a measuring cup. Double the measurement to determine how much stock or water to cook the rice in. The plastic liner is not a hygiene thing: it is just that if you don\'t use it, you will spend ages scraping out the rice. I know whereof I speak.\n\nThe result is beautiful, whole and oven-scorched. It is very gratifying to slice through the pumpkin and hand out glorious coral-fleshed, rice-nubbly wedges to a tableful of hungry guests. The pumpkin\'s skin softens enough as it bakes, making cutting easy.\n\nI like to eat this dish just as it is  it makes a warm, welcoming meal after a chilly evening of trick-or-treating  but it is also very good with a tomato sauce poured over each slice as you serve. To make the sauce, you need do no more than finely chop an onion and soften it in a little oil in a pan. Then mince in a clove of garlic, add a can or two of chopped canned tomatoes, a teaspoon of sugar and salt and a grinding of pepper, and cook for 20 minutes until everything has amalgamated into a thick red sauce. Sometimes I add half a teaspoon of ground ginger to it along with the garlic. Sometimes I throw in an inch of fresh garlic, removing it once the sauce is cooked.\n\nWith or without the sauce, this is a fine meal, worth bearing in mind to serve at Thanksgiving if you have vegetarians at your table: it is quite as spectacularly celebratory as a roast turkey.\n\nThe cookies here have none of the pumpkin\'s autumnal majesty, but Halloween is not one of the most dignified of festivals. These monster cookies, studded with colored candies (delicious if they are peanut-filled, too), are an amazing way to end a grown-up supper, and a very useful way to keep a roomful of boisterous children happy.',1,@cat4,@subcat8,PARSEDATETIME('2004-10-29','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

If not, add another tablespoon of water, and pulse 1 or 2 times more. Don\'t overmix so that the dough forms a ball.\n\n2. Turn out dough on a large sheet of plastic wrap. Lift ends of plastic to gather dough together inside. Press into a large disk, and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use, up to 2 days.\n\n3. To make the filling, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrot, celery, leeks and tarragon, and cook, stirring, just until slightly softened but not browned (reduce the heat if necessary to prevent browning), about 3 minutes. Transfer cooked vegetables to a bowl, wipe out the skillet, and place it back on the stove.\n\n4. Add remaining 3 tablespoons butter, and melt over medium heat. Whisk in flour, and cook, whisking, until the mixture bubbles and smells cooked. Do not let it brown. Whisk in 2 cups broth, and cook, whisking, 1 minute. Whisk in cream, and cook 2 or 3 minutes, just until thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If the sauce is too thick, whisk in remaining broth.\n\n5. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Add cooked vegetables and peas, chicken and sauce to 8-ounce deep pie dish or other baking dish, mix gently, and taste for seasoning.\n\n6. Flour a work surface. Remove dough from refrigerator, and cut in half. (Set aside half for another recipe.) Roll out remaining dough, turning and flouring often, and cut a shape approximately the size of your baking dish plus 1½ inches overlap all around.\n\n7. Whisk egg in a small bowl. Brush onto rim of dish. Roll dough up onto the rolling pin, and unroll over dish, so it rests evenly on top of filling. Press overlap onto the rim and against the outside of the dish, sealing tightly. Poke tip of knife through crust to create 3 vent holes near the center. Place on cookie sheet, and place in oven.\n\n8. Bake 20 minutes, then reduce temperature to 375 degrees. Bake 15 to 20 minutes more, until crust is golden and filling is bubbling through vents. Let rest 10 minutes before serving.\n\nYield: 8 servings.\n',1,@cat4,@subcat9,PARSEDATETIME('2005-02-23','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

With minor modifications, it can also be made in a paella pan (see instructions below). Dry-cured Spanish chorizo is the sausage of choice for paella, but fresh chorizo or linguiça is an acceptable substitute. Soccarat, a layer of crusty browned rice that forms on the bottom of the pan, is a traditional part of paella. In our version, soccarat does not develop because most of the cooking is done in the oven. We have provided instructions to develop soccarat in step 5; if you prefer, skip this step and go directly from step 4 to 6.\n\nServes 6\n1 	pound extra-large shrimp (21/25), peeled and deveined\n	Table salt and ground black pepper \n	olive oil \n8-9 	medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 tablespoons)\n1 	pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs , each thigh trimmed of excess fat and halved crosswise\n1 	red bell pepper , seeded and cut pole to pole into 1/2-inch-wide strips\n8 	ounces Spanish chorizo , sliced 1/2 inch thick on the bias (see note)\n1 	medium onion , chopped fine (about 1 cup)\n	1 can (14 1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes , drained, minced, and drained again\n2 	cups Valencia rice or Arborio\n3 	cups low-sodium chicken broth \n1/3 	cup dry white wine \n1/2 	teaspoon saffron threads , crumbled\n1 	bay leaf \n1 	dozen mussels , scrubbed and debearded\n1/2 	cup frozen green peas , thawed\n2 	teaspoons chopped fresh parsley leaves  \n1 	lemon , cut into wedges, for serving\n\n\n1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Toss shrimp, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon oil, and 1 teaspoon garlic in medium bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper; set aside.\n\n2. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, until skin begins to blister and turn spotty black, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer peppers to small plate and set aside.\n\n3. Add 1 teaspoon oil to now-empty Dutch oven; heat oil until shimmering but not smoking. Add chicken pieces in single layer; cook, without moving pieces, until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn pieces and brown on second side, about 3 minutes longer; transfer chicken to medium bowl. Reduce heat to medium and add chorizo to pot; cook, stirring frequently, until deeply browned and fat begins to render, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer chorizo to bowl with chicken and set aside.\n\n4. Add enough oil to fat in Dutch oven to equal 2 tablespoons; heat over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 3 minutes; stir in remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes; cook until mixture begins to darken and thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in rice and cook until grains are well coated with tomato mixture, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, wine, saffron, bay, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Return chicken and chorizo to pot, increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally. Cover pot and transfer to oven; cook until rice absorbs almost all liquid, about 15 minutes. Remove pot from oven (close oven door to retain heat). Uncover pot; scatter shrimp over rice, insert mussels hinged side down into rice (so they stand upright), arrange bell pepper strips in pinwheel pattern, and scatter peas over top. Cover and return to oven; cook until shrimp are opaque and mussels have opened, 10 to 12 minutes.\n\n5. Optional: If soccarat (see note) is desired, set Dutch oven, uncovered, over medium-high heat about 5 minutes, rotating pot 180 degrees after about 2 minutes for even browning.\n\n6. Let paella stand, covered, about 5 minutes. Discard any mussels that have not opened and bay leaf, if it can be easily removed. Sprinkle with parsley and serve, passing lemon wedges separately.\n\n7. If You\'re Using a Paella Pan\nA paella pan makes for an attractive and impressive presentation. Use one that is 14 to 15 inches in diameter. A 14-inch ovensafe skillet will work as well, but do not attempt to use anything smaller because the contents will simply not fit. Follow the recipe for Paella, increasing the chicken broth to 3 1/4 cups and the wine to 1/2 cup. Before placing the pan in the oven, cover it tightly with foil.

Wood chunks help flavor the meat; hickory is the traditional choice with pork, although mesquite can be used if desired.

Wrap tightly in double layer of plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 3 hours. (For strong flavor, the roast can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)\n\n3. At least 1 hour prior to cooking, remove roast from refrigerator, unwrap, and let it come to room temperature. Soak 4 (3-inch) wood chunks in cold water to cover for 1 hour and drain.

Empty the coals into the grill; build a modified two-level fire by spreading the coals onto one side of the grill, piling them up in a mound 2 or 3 briquettes high, leaving the other half with no coals. Open the bottom vents completely. Place the soaked wood chunks on the coals. Position the cooking grate over the coals, cover the grill, and heat until hot, about 5 minutes (you can hold your hand 5 inches above the coals for 2 seconds). Use a grill brush to scrape the cooking grate clean.\n\n5. Set unwrapped roast in disposable pan (see illustration below) and place it on grate opposite the fire, (see illustrations below). Open grill lid vents three-quarters of the way and cover, turning lid so that vents are opposite chunks to draw smoke through the grill. Cook, adding about 8 briquettes every hour or so to maintain an average temperature of 275 degrees, for 3 hours.\n\n6. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Measure 3 tablespoons for use in this recipe. Extra rub can be stored (or frozen) in an airtight container for several weeks.\n\n2. For Chicken: Soak the wood chunks or chips in cold water to cover for 1 hour and drain. If using wood chips, divide them between two 18-inch squares of aluminum foil, seal to make two packets, and use a fork to create about six holes in each packet to allow smoke to escape.\n\n3. Massage the spice rub all over the chicken, inside and out. Lift up the skin over the breast and rub the spice rub directly onto the meat. Open the beer can and drink about 1/4 cup. With a church key can opener, punch two more large holes in the top of the can (for a total of three holes). Crumble the bay leaves into the beer. Slide the chicken over the can so that the drumsticks reach down to the bottom of the can and the chicken stands upright; set aside at room temperature.\n\n4. Light a large chimney starter filled two-thirds with charcoal (4 quarts, or about 60 briquettes) and allow to burn until the coals are fully ignited and partially covered with a thin layer of ash, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n5.

Nestle 1 soaked wood chunk (or 1 foil packet) on top of each coal pile. Position the cooking grate over the coals, cover the grill, and heat until hot, about 5 minutes; scrape the grate clean with a grill brush.\n\n6. Place the chicken (with the can) in the center of the cooking grate with the wings facing the coals (the ends of the drumsticks will touch the grate and help steady the bird). Cover and grill-roast, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 170 to 175 degrees, 65 to 85 minutes.\n\n7. With a large wad of paper towels in each hand, transfer the chicken to a platter or tray, making sure to keep the can upright; let rest for 15 minutes.

In step 6, set the chickens (and cans) in the middle of the cooking grate, with the chickens breasts facing one another, about 3 inches apart (keeping the chickens close together ensures that they wont hit the top of the domed grill lid).

However, we streamlined the ragù by using sweet Italian sausage instead of the traditional beef, pork, and/or veal blend. \n\nNotes: Imported, commercially produced dried lasagna noodles (the kind you boil first) work well in this recipe, but if you can find fresh noodles at a specialty shop, try those instead. Just boil the noodles a few at a time for 2 minutes, plunge in an ice bath, and dry before assembling.\n\n\nAbout 7 tbsp. butter\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n1/2 cup onion, cut into 1/4-in. dice\n1/2 cup carrots, cut into 1/4-in. dice\n1/2 cup celery, cut into 1/4-in. dice\n1 pound bulk sweet Italian sausage (or 1 lb. sausage links removed from their casings)\nAbout 1 1/2 tsp. salt\n4 cups whole milk\n1/2 cup dry white wine\n1 can (28 oz.) whole tomatoes, including juices, finely chopped or crushed with your hands\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/4 cup flour\n1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n12 ounces lasagna noodles (see Notes)\n1 cup good-quality grated Parmesan\n\n1. In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt 2 tbsp. butter in oil over medium heat. Add onion and cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Add carrots and celery and cook 5 more minutes. Add sausage and 1/2 tsp. salt, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, and cook until meat loses its raw color.\n\n2. Add 1 cup milk and cook over medium heat, stirring, until completely absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes. (The milk will appear quite curdled at this point; don\'t be alarmed.) Add wine and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, bring to a boil, lower heat, and gently simmer, uncovered, 2 hours. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n3. After the ragù has cooked for 1 1/2 hours, make the béchamel by melting remaining 5 tbsp. butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until it turns light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Slowly drizzle in remaining 3 cups milk, whisking constantly. Bring to a simmer and continue to cook, whisking, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with remaining 1 tsp. salt, nutmeg, and pepper to taste.\n\n4. Preheat oven to 375°. Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions, being careful not to overcook. Drain and lay flat on dish towels, making sure the noodles do not overlap. Butter the bottom of a 9- by 13-in. baking dish and coat with about 1/2 cup of ragù. Add a single layer of noodles (for most brands this is 4 sheets per layer). Spread on 1/3 of the béchamel; top béchamel with 1/4 of the remaining ragù, then 1/4 of the parmesan. Repeat layering two more times, covering final layer with remaining ragù and parmesan.\n\n5.

Drain, cool, squeeze dry and chop. Then toss with oil, salt and lots of lemon juice. Serve with more lemon, oil, salt and pepper.

Chop the eggplant flesh (leave the peel behind) and roughly mash in the bowl. Add red pepper flakes if you like. Serve with pita.\n\n23 Simmer one part olive oil, two parts red wine vinegar and four parts water with herbs, salt and pepper. Add chopped vegetables, firmest to softest  maybe carrots first, then cauliflower, then peppers  and poach until just getting tender. Remove from heat and chill overnight in the liquid. Its giardiniera.\n\n24 Cut zucchini into big chunks and roast or grill with olive oil (and, if you like, whole garlic cloves). Combine with chopped seeded tomatoes, lemon juice, dill, salt and pepper.\n\n25 Toss cauliflower florets with oil, salt and pepper, and roast in a hot oven until browned and cooked; while still warm, toss with curry powder and a handful of raisins.

Garnish with toasted sesame seeds.\n\n27 Clean a bunch of mixed mushrooms; quarter any large ones. Steam for about five minutes. When still warm, toss with sliced shallots, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper, cracked coriander seeds, chopped fresh cilantro, sherry vinegar and more olive oil if necessary.\n\n28 In a blender or food processor, combine ginger, a half cup or so light miso, a little more than that of walnuts, and enough soy sauce to make a sauce.

Add diced red and green pepper, some corn kernels and a minced jalapeño. Season with lime juice, chopped marjoram or oregano, salt and pepper.\n\n32 Cook lentils with garlic, onion and thyme.

Toss with chopped seeded tomatoes, cilantro, soy sauce and a suspicion of sesame oil. Salt and pepper.\n\n35 Steam frozen edamame and chill. Toss with olive oil, lemon juice, a pinch of sugar, lots of chopped mint, salt, pepper, and as much shaved pecorino or Parmesan as you like.\n\n36 Mix cooked rice and cooked lentils with very, very well caramelized onions. Add sherry vinegar, salt, pepper and, if necessary, a bit of oil.\n\n37 Combine cooked brown rice with small, barely cooked broccoli florets and chopped pecans or walnuts and parsley.

Cooked cauliflower is good, too.\n\n41 Toss a load of chopped parsley with a little cooked bulgur  say three to one in favor of the parsley. Chopped seeded tomatoes, olive oil, salt, pepper and lots of lemon juice. Call this real tabbouleh.\n\n42 Make tabbouleh as above and embellish with more vegetables  like cucumbers and radishes  and/or crumbled feta, or bits of cooked chicken. Or smoked tofu, or bacon, whatever you can think of. How can you go wrong? \n\nPOTATO SALADS AND EGG SALADS\n\n43 Make potato salad with mustard vinaigrette. Add chopped cooked asparagus, peas, green beans, etc. Or steamed mussels.\n\n44 Make potato salad with mayo and crumbled bacon, and add grated Cheddar, celery, onion and chopped egg. You dont have to pack much else except blood thinner.\n\n45 Roast or boil sweet potatoes, but not too soft. Make a blended vinaigrette with a little chili, cumin, sherry vinegar and olive oil. Pack separately and toss together with scallions and mint.\n\n46 Make egg salad with sesame oil and seeds, soy sauce, rice vinegar, scallions and chilies.\n\n47 Egg salad with chopped seeded tomato, basil and extra virgin olive oil.\n\n48 Egg salad with sour cream, smoked salmon and chopped chives.\n\nALSO\n\n49 Take cold pizza and lemon. Squeeze lemon over pizza. Really.\n\n50 Mix a couple of cups of cold leftover cooked short-grain rice (if you happen to have risotto lying around, so much the better) with three eggs. Form balls; insert a small cube of mozzarella into each. Roll in bread crumbs and refrigerate if convenient. Deep or shallow fry until golden. Packed carefully, these will be fine. Call them supplì al telefono.\n\n51 Purée roasted red peppers (jarred are O.K., piquillo are even better) with feta, marjoram or oregano and parsley, olive oil and garlic. Serve as a dip.\n\n52 Make burritos, using the biggest flour tortillas you can find: rice, beans, any stewed or grilled meat or chicken, cilantro, salsa.\n\n53 Marinate firm goat or feta cheese in olive oil, with rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, red and black pepper. You dont need much of this, but its good.\n\n54 Make a cheese ball: Mash together equal parts good grated Cheddar, crumbled blue and cream cheese, maybe thinned with a little sour cream. Shape into a ball and roll in fresh chopped herbs and/or hazelnuts. Take Triscuits. You think people wont eat this? \n\nFRUIT\n\n55 Make simple syrup with rosemary; purée in a blender with watermelon, rum (optional) and lemon juice. Use more rum and call this a cocktail, or omit rum, add a little feta and eat with a spoon. Keep it cold in either case.\n\n56 Use a spoon or melon baller to make equal size pieces of watermelon, honeydew, cantaloupe, or, I dont know, Charentais. Mix together and sprinkle with lemon juice and salt or (better still) chili, sugar, salt and lime.\n\n57 (A) Make fruit salad, however you like it; pack it. (B) Take seeded papaya halves, well wrapped. Put (A) in (B), drizzle with lemon, and serve.\n\n58 Husk and quarter strawberries; at the last minute, combine with a little chopped tarragon, black pepper and balsamic vinegar. Goat cheese is good, too.\n\n59 Cut melon into wedges and wrap thin slices of prosciutto around them. Stack in a container, drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper. Take romaine lettuce and serve the wedges over the greens, with the accumulated juices as a dressing. It works.\n\n60 Toss cornbread cubes with blueberries, lemon juice, olive oil and hazelnuts. Yes. \n\nSEAFOOD\n\n61 Toss chopped shrimp or shredded crab or lobster with lemon juice, chopped chives, salt and pepper. Use this to fill avocado halves. (If the avocado browns, blame me. Itll still taste great.)\n\n62 Boil potatoes, corn kernels and shrimp; drain and chill. Serve with crusty bread and lemon wedges along with mayo mixed with garlic and crumbled saffron. Call this Aegean seafood salad.\n\n63 Drain a can of good quality salmon (preferably sockeye). Mix with cannellini beans, chopped tomato, diced shallot, chopped black or green olives, chopped parsley and basil. Dress with olive oil and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Serve on bread (scooped out ciabatta is very nice) or over greens.\n\n64 Combine a bunch of watercress or arugula with thinly sliced radishes and red onion; add flaked smoked trout or whitefish. Dress at the last minute with olive oil, sherry vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt and pepper.\n\n65 Cut salmon fillets (the skin can be on or off) into serving-size pieces, and sear them in oil on both sides until brown; set aside. Sauté onions, garlic, fresh chilies if you like; deglaze the pan with one part red wine vinegar, two parts each red wine and water. Pour over fish and chill for up to two days. This will work with mackerel, chicken, pork, etc. Call this escabeche.\n\n66 Make escabeche with white wine and vinegar, dill and lemon slices.\n\n67 Pan-cook shrimp in oil. Separately sauté fresh and dried chilies with lots of onions and garlic; add beer, reduce and pour glaze over shrimp.\n\n68 Mix good canned tuna with diced fennel, tarragon, lemon juice, salt and pepper. No mayo.\n\n69 Mix good tuna with mashed anchovies (packed in olive oil), grated Parmesan, bits of lemon and some lemon juice, olive oil and perhaps a thimbleful of Worcestershire. No mayo.\n\n70 You want an idea for tuna with mayo, I know: Mix tuna with mayo and mustard; add capers and dill.\n\nMEAT AND POULTRY\n\n71 Cut chicken wings into two parts, toss with olive oil, salt and pepper, and grill or roast until crisp and golden. Whisk together mustard, honey and lemon juice, and toss with warm wings. Chill overnight (or eat them and take something else to the picnic).\n\n72 Combine equal parts soy sauce, mirin and sake with a little sugar and sesame oil; boil for a minute. Use this to baste chicken thighs, pork or beef while you grill or broil it. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and/or chopped scallions  ginger and/or lemon are good too  just before serving. Call it teriyaki. Works with mackerel and other dark fish, too.\n\n73 Make chicken teriyaki as above, then toss with a little mayo and perhaps more soy. Awesome.\n\n74 Poach chicken and chop or shred. Toss with lemon juice, olive oil and herbs of your choice.\n\n75 Pack in three containers: grilled sliced beef or pork, with its juices; watercress or arugula tossed with mint, basil and/or cilantro; a dressing of lime juice, sesame oil, fish or soy sauce and sugar. Dress greens; put meat and its juices over all.\n\n76 Thinly slice grilled butterflied leg of lamb; toss with cherry tomatoes, olive oil, mint, feta and chopped red onion.\n\n77 Grind chunks of lamb shoulder in a food processor with onion, parsley, salt and pepper. Make into small meatballs and sauté or roast. Serve sliced with pita wedges or in pita, with lemon, and a dollop of yogurt or tapenade.\n\n78 Split small chickens or Cornish hens; grill or broil quickly, with lots of salt and pepper. Take them whole to the picnic with sandwich rolls, good barbecue sauce (O.K., and mayo) and pickles. Pick off the meat and go to it.\n\n79 Cut quail in half, or not; marinate with salt, pepper, minced garlic, sage and oil for as long as you can  at least five minutes. Grill for 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n80 Chop various salamis, mortadella, etc. and combine with chopped provolone, Parmesan, bell pepper, red onion and fresh oregano. Heavily dress in vinaigrette. Take shredded romaine lettuce for tossing. And bread, obviously. \n\nSANDWICHES\n\n81 Make chopped olive salad (I like onion, thyme, capers, a little garlic). Hollow out a medium-size round bread, or a few rolls. Put in olive salad and cured meats of your choice: ham, prosciutto, salami, mortadella, whatever; and provolone. Call this a muffuletta.\n\n82 Slice open a good baguette and fill it with chopped or shredded cooked chicken tossed with fish sauce, chili, sugar, lime, garlic, scallions and Thai basil (or, in a dire emergency, regular).\n\n83 Fry chopped bacon until half done; add strips of boneless chicken and cook until done; pack. Take pitas, chopped seeded tomato, avocado, sliced red onion and shredded romaine. Assemble sandwiches in situ; dress with olive oil and cheap vinegar.\n\n84 Blanch frozen fava beans in salted water. Pulse in a food processor with some mint or parsley until roughly chopped; season with salt, pepper and fresh lemon juice. Slice baguette and spread one half with fresh ricotta, then drizzle with olive oil. Spread the other half with the fava beans. Put arugula in there and sandwich-ize.\n\n85 Butter both halves of a sliced baguette. Layer with thinly sliced cured ham  Serrano, prosciutto, Bayonne, York, whatever  and many halved cornichons. Call this une sandwich.\n\n86 Halve a cucumber or two; scoop out the seeds. Slice it thin and salt it for a bit if you have time; in any case squeeze out some of the liquid. Combine it with shredded cooked chicken, ginger, soy sauce, salt, pepper and cilantro. On a baguette, its reminiscent of banh mi.\n\n87 Grill a steak; slice it thin. Butter a baguette on one side; put Dijon on the other side. Pile the bread with steak, roasted peppers (canned are fine; piquillos are best), and something crunchy, like radicchio or fennel. A little blue cheese wouldnt hurt either. Neither would avocado. (But not both.)\n\n88 Cook peeled shrimp; little ones are best. Toss with pesto: lots. Put on small rolls. (In fact: cook anything; toss with pesto: lots. Put on small rolls.)\n\n89 Dredge fish fillets in cornmeal. Sauté in abundant olive oil until crisp. Let cool a bit, then use for sandwiches, packing tomatoes separately.\n\n90 Hard-cook some eggs; slice them. Sauté some spinach with oil and garlic until quite dry; chop. Make mustardy sandwiches with baguettes, rolls or any bread that can absorb some oil.\n\nCOLD NOODLES\n\n91 Cook fusilli or other cut pasta; rinse in cool water, but dont bother to chill. Combine with chopped seeded tomatoes, cubed fresh mozzarella, chopped basil, olive oil, salt and pepper. (Good with olives, too.) Do not call this pasta salad, because pasta salad is no good, and this is.\n\n92 Shred carrots and zucchini. Mix lime juice, soy sauce, grated ginger and sesame oil. Cook soba noodles, drain and rinse under cold water. Toss noodles with the vegetables and dressing.\n\n93 Cook rice vermicelli and drain. Toss with kimchi, lots of cilantro and cooked chopped shrimp or chicken.\n\n94 Cook garlic in olive oil until just sizzling; add clams (you can use canned clams but it will not be the same), and, cook, stirring, until they open. Remove, chop and combine with the garlic, oil, any liquid in pan, chopped tomato and cooked pasta. Add more oil as needed, with lemon juice, parsley, salt (if needed), pepper and oregano, if you like. \n\nDESSERTS\n\n95 Combine equal parts honey and brown sugar with a little oil and bring to a boil; toss with good granola until the mixture is very sticky. You can add more nuts, or raisins and, yes, O.K., you can add chocolate chips. Line a pan with waxed paper or film with oil. Press mixture into pan and let cool. Call these granola bars.\n\n96 Cook a couple of pounds of berries with some sugar and a little water until they break down. Layer in a plastic container with slices of good pound cake. Pour any remaining juices on top. You might want some cream.\n\n97 Make sandwiches of angel food cake and ganache or fruit compote.\n\n98 Mix peanut butter and cream cheese. Spread between two good cookies and make sandwiches. Or mix honey, lemon zest and cream cheese. Make sandwiches with ginger snaps.\n\n99 Put sorbet (make it yourself if you have time) in a really cold thermos; it will be slushy by the time you open it. Add a splash of Champagne or Gewürztraminer if you like, maybe some mint, and eat like cold soup.\n\n100 Take a container of melted chocolate thinned with cream or crème fraîche with strawberries, pineapple or bananas for dipping.\n\n101 Take the makings of Smores.

Stir together the flour, salt, and instant yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). With a large metal spoon, stir in the oil and the cold water until the flour is all absorbed (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment), If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. If you are using an electric mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is too wet and doesn\'t come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour just until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of the bowl, dribble in a tea- spoon or two of cold water. The finished dough will be springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky, and register 50 to 55F.\n\n2. Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Prepare a sheet pan by lining it with baking parchment and misting the parchment with spray oil (or lightly oil the parchment). Using a metal dough scraper, cut the dough into 6 equal pieces (or larger if you are comfortable shaping large pizzas), You can dip the scraper into the water between cuts to keep the dough from sticking to it, Sprinkle flour over the dough. Make sure your hands are dry and then flour them. Lift each piece and gently round it into a ball. If the dough sticks to your hands, dip your hands into the flour again. Transfer the dough balls to the sheet pan, Mist the dough generously with spray oil and slip the pan into a food-grade plastic bag.\n\n3. Put the pan into the refrigerator overnight to rest the dough, or keep for up to 3 days. (Note: If you want to save some of the dough for future baking, you can store the dough balls in a zippered freezer bag. Dip each dough ball into a bowl that has a few tablespoons of oil in it, rolling the dough in the oil, and then put each ball into a separate bag. You can place the bags into the freezer for up to 3 months. Transfer them to the refrigerator the day before you plan to make pizza.)\n\n4. On the day you plan to make the pizza, remove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before making the pizza. Before letting the dough rest at room temperature for 2 hours, dust the counter with flour, and then mist the counter with spray oil. Place the dough balls on top of the floured counter and sprinkle them with flour; dust your hands with flour. Gently press the dough into flat disks about 1/2 inch thick and 5 inches in diameter. Sprinkle the dough with flour, mist it again with spray oil, and cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag. Now let rest for 2 hours.\n\n5. At least 45 minutes before making the pizza, place a baking stone either on the floor of the oven (for gas ovens), or on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Heat the oven as hot as possible, up to 800F (most home ovens will go only to 500 to 550F, but some will go higher). If you do not have a baking stone, you can use the back of a sheet pan, but do not preheat the pan.\n\n6. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal. Make the pizzas one at a time. Dip your hands, including the backs of your hands and knuckles, in flour and lift I piece of dough by getting under it with a pastry scraper. Very gently lay the dough across your fists and carefully stretch it by bouncing the dough in a circular motion on your hands, carefully giving it a little stretch with each bounce. If it begins to stick to your hands, lay it down on the floured counter and reflour your hands, then continue shaping it. Once the dough has expanded outward, move to a full toss as shown on page 208. If you have trouble tossing the dough, or if the dough keeps springing back, let it rest for 5 to 20 minutes so the gluten can relax, and try again. You can also resort to using a rolling pin, though this isn\'t as effective as the toss method.\n\n7. When the dough is stretched out to your satisfaction (about 9 to 12 inches in diameter for a 6-ounce piece of dough), lay it on the peel or pan, making sure there is enough semolina flour or cornmeal to allow it to slide. Lightly top it with sauce and then with your other top- pings, remembering that the best pizzas are topped with a less-is-more philosophy. The American \"kitchen sink\" approach is counterproductive, as it makes the crust more difficult to bake. A few, usually no more than 3 or 4 toppings, including sauce and cheese is sufficient.\n\n8. Slide the topped pizza onto the stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan) and close the door. Wait 2 minutes, then take a peek. If it needs to be rotated 180 degrees for even baking, do so. The pizza should take about 5 to 8 minutes to bake. If the top gets done before the bottom, you will need to move the stone to a lower self before the next round. if the bottom crisps before the cheese caramelizes, then you will need to raise the stone for subsequent bakes.\n\n9. Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Wait 3 to 5 minutes before slicing and serving, to allow the cheese to set slightly.\n\nMakes six 6-ounce pizza crusts.\n\nfrom The Bread Baker\'s Apprentice by Peter Reinhart (Ten Speed Press)',1,@cat2,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2009-05-27','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Put your stock or broth into a saucepan, and bring it to a simmer on the stove, with a ladle nearby or in the pot. Make sure that it is well seasoned. Combine the herbs and one of the minced garlic cloves in a bowl, and set aside.\n\n2. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a wide, heavy skillet or saucepan. Add the onion or leek and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook gently until it is just tender, about three minutes. Do not brown.\n\n3. Stir in the rice and the remaining three cloves of garlic, and stir just until the grains of rice become separate and begin to crackle. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until it is absorbed.\n\n4. Begin adding the simmering stock, a couple of ladlefuls (about 1/2 cup) at a time. The stock should just cover the rice and should be bubbling, not too slowly but not too quickly. When the rice is just tender all the way through but still chewy, usually in 20 to 25 minutes, it is done. Taste now and correct seasoning.\n\n5. Add another ladleful of stock to the rice. Stir in the herbs, pepper, lemon zest and juice, and Parmesan, and remove from the heat. The mixture should be creamy. If you put some on a plate and tilt the plate the mound of rice should flatten out. Serve right away.\n\nYield: Serves four.\n\nAdvance preparation: You can begin up to several hours before serving. Proceed with the recipe, and cook halfway through step 4  that is, for about 15 minutes. The rice should still be hard when you remove it from the heat, and there should not be any liquid in the pan. Spread it in an even layer in the pan, and keep it away from the heat until you resume cooking. If the pan is not wide enough for you to spread the rice in a thin layer, transfer it to a sheet pan. Fifteen minutes before serving, resume cooking as instructed. ',1,@cat8,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2009-06-23','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Cube watermelon and combine with tomato chunks, basil and basic vinaigrette. You can substitute peach for the watermelon or the tomato (but not both, O.K.?). You can also add bacon or feta, but there goes the vegan-ness.\n\n2. Mix wedges of tomatoes and peaches, add slivers of red onion, a few red-pepper flakes and cilantro. Dress with olive oil and lime or lemon juice. Astonishing.\n\n3. A nice cucumber salad: Slice cucumbers thin (if theyre fat and old, peel and seed them first), toss with red onions and salt, then let sit for 20 to 60 minutes. Rinse, dry, dress with cider vinegar mixed with Dijon mustard; no oil necessary.\n\n4. Shave raw asparagus stalks with a vegetable peeler. Discard the tough first pass of the peeler  i.e., the peel  but do use the tips, whole. Dress with lemon vinaigrette and coarse salt. (Chopped hard-boiled eggs optional but good.)\n\n5. Grate or very thinly slice Jerusalem artichokes; mix with pitted and chopped oil-cured olives, olive oil, lemon juice and a sprinkling of coarsely ground cumin. Unusual and wonderful.\n\n6. Sichuan slaw: Toss bean sprouts, shredded carrots and celery, minced fresh chili, soy sauce, sesame oil and a bit of sugar. Top with chopped peanuts and chopped basil, mint and/or cilantro. (The full trio is best.)\n\n7. Grate carrots, toast some sunflower seeds, and toss with blueberries, olive oil, lemon juice and plenty of black pepper. Sweet, sour, crunchy, soft.\n\n8. Chop or slice radishes (or jicama, or the ever-surprising kohlrabi) and combine with chopped or sliced unripe (i.e., still crunchy) mango, lime juice and mint or cilantro.\n\n9. Chop or slice jicama (or radishes or kohlrabi) and mango and mix with coconut milk, lime juice, curry powder and cilantro or mint.\n\n10.

Chop and steam baby or grown-up bok choy until crisp-tender, then shock it in ice water. Drain, then toss with halved cherry tomatoes, capers, olive oil and lemon juice.\n\n12. Combine sliced fennel and prune plums; serve with vinaigrette spiked with minced ginger. Nice pairing.\n\n13. A red salad: Combine tomato wedges with halved strawberries, basil leaves, shaved Parmesan and balsamic vinegar.\n\n14. A classic Moroccan thing: Thinly slice carrots, or grate or shred them (the food processor makes quick work of this). Toss with toasted cumin seeds, olive oil, lemon juice and cilantro. Raisins are good in here, too. There is no better use of raw carrots.\n\n15. Cut cherry or grape tomatoes in half; toss with soy sauce, a bit of dark sesame oil and basil or cilantro. I love this  the tomato juice-soy thing is incredible.\n\n16. Slice fennel and crisp apple about the same thickness (your choice). Combine, then dress with mustardy vinaigrette and chopped parsley. Come fall, this will be even better.\n\n17. With thanks to Szechuan Gourmet restaurant: Finely chop celery and mix with a roughly equal amount of pressed or smoked tofu, chopped.

Roughly chop cooked or canned chickpeas (you can pulse them, carefully, in a food processor) and toss with olive oil, lemon juice, lots of chopped fresh parsley and mint, and a few chopped tomatoes. Call this chickpea tabbouleh.\n\n19. Mix cooked cannellini or other white beans, chopped cherry or grape tomatoes and arugula or baby spinach. Lightly toast sliced garlic in olive oil with rosemary and red pepper flakes; cool slightly, add lemon zest or juice or both, then pour over beans.\n\n20. Shred Napa cabbage and radishes. The dressing is roasted peanuts, lime juice, peanut or other oil, cilantro and fresh or dried chili, all whizzed in a blender. Deliciousness belies ease.\n\n21. Dice cucumbers (if theyre fat and old, peel and seed them first) and toss with cubes of avocado, a little mirin (or honey, but then its not vegan), rice vinegar and soy sauce. (You could mix in a little lump crab meat, really not vegan, even rice, and call it a California roll salad.)\n\n22.

Quite elegant, actually.\n\n25. Combine chopped bell peppers, tomatoes, red onion, chilies and cilantro, then toss with corn tortilla strips, toasted in a 350-degree oven until crisp (or yes, use packaged chips; why not?). Dust with chili powder and lots of lime juice.\n\n26. Combine mushroom caps and thinly sliced red onions with olive oil; broil gently until tender and browned. Toss with a lot of chopped fresh parsley or basil (or both) and a simple vinaigrette. Some chopped escarole, arugula or watercress is good, too.\n\n27. Cook whole, unpeeled eggplant in a dry, hot skillet or on a grill, turning occasionally, until completely collapsed and soft. Chop and toss with toasted pita, toasted pine nuts, cooked white beans and halved cherry tomatoes. Dress with olive oil, lemon juice and lots of black pepper. Or a (non-vegan) yogurt dressing is good, especially one laced with tahini.\n\n28. Toss mâche or another soft green with toasted slivered almonds and roughly chopped fresh figs. Thin some almond butter with water and sherry vinegar to taste and use as a dressing. Some will like this with fresh goat cheese.\n\n29. Pit and halve cherries (or halve and pit cherries), then cook gently with olive oil and a little balsamic vinegar until they break down. Toss with chopped radicchio, endive, escarole or a combination, some toasted hazelnuts and more oil and vinegar, if necessary.\n\n30. Fast, grown-up potato salad: Boil bite-size red potatoes.

Toss with vinaigrette, chopped scallions or red onion, and parsley.\n\n34. Grill quartered romaine hearts, radicchio and/or endive. Drizzle with olive oil and sherry vinegar, and add dill and chopped shallots. Teeny-tiny croutons are great on this.\n\n35.

Mix cooked or canned chickpeas with toasted coconut, shredded carrots, chopped celery, curry powder, olive oil, lime juice and cilantro.\n\nVEGETARIAN SALADS\n\n37. Cube smoked tofu, then brush it with a mixture of honey and orange juice; broil until browned. Toss with chopped cucumbers, radishes and peas or pea shoots; drizzle with soy sauce and lime juice.\n\n38. Cube watermelon; combine with roughly chopped mint, crumbled feta, sliced red onion and chopped Kalamata olives. Dress lightly with olive oil and lemon juice. Despite saltiness of feta and olives, this may need salt.\n\n39. Yucatecan street food as salad: Roast fresh corn kernels in a pan with a little oil; toss with cayenne or minced chilis, lime juice and a little queso fresco. Cherry tomatoes are optional.\n\n40. Slice cucumber and top with capers, olive oil, lots of pepper and little dollops of fresh ricotta. Note: cucumbers, ricotta and oil must all be really good.\n\n41. Halve avocados and scoop out some but not all of their flesh. Roughly chop and toss with black beans, queso fresco, cilantro, chopped tomatillos and lime juice. Serve in the meaty avocado shells.\n\n42. Trim crusts if necessary from day-or-two-old bread (or even three-day-old bread), cube and marinate in black olive tapenade thinned with more olive oil. Add chopped capers and toss with tomatoes, basil and mozzarella. (Anchovies optional.)\n\n43. Grate raw beets (use the food processor to avoid ruining everything within spattering distance) and toss with watercress or arugula. Top with sherry vinaigrette and a little goat cheese. Especially obvious, perhaps, but also especially popular.\n\n44. Make a crisp grilled cheese sandwich, with good bread and not too much good cheese. Let it cool, then cut into croutons. Put them on anything, but especially tomato and basil salad. This you will do forever.\n\n45. Halve or quarter cooked artichoke hearts (the best are fresh and grilled, but you can use canned or frozen) and combine with cherry tomatoes, bits of feta or Parmesan or both, olive oil and lemon juice.\n\n46. Sauté mushrooms and shallots in olive oil. Add a lot of spinach, chopped unless the leaves are small. When it wilts, stir in parsley and crumbled blue cheese. Feels like a steakhouse side-dish salad.\n\n47. Thinly slice raw button mushrooms; combine with sliced or shaved Parmesan, parsley and a vinaigrette of olive oil, sherry vinegar and shallots.\n\n48. Toss roughly chopped dandelion greens (or arugula or watercress) with chopped preserved lemon, chickpeas, crumbled feta and olive oil. (Before you start cursing me out, heres a quick way to make preserved lemons: chop whole lemons and put in a bowl with the juice of another lemon or two, sprinkle with a fair amount of salt and let sit for an hour or so.)\n\n49. Toss greens with walnuts, blue cheese and raspberries; drizzle with a simple vinaigrette. Sell for $14 a serving.\n\n50. Its puttanesca-ish: Egg salad with pitted black olives, chopped tomatoes, capers, anchovies (optional), a tiny bit of garlic and some red onion; mayonnaise as needed.\n\n51. Arrange sliced ripe tomatoes and hard-boiled eggs on a platter; scatter a handful of chopped pitted green olives on top. Drizzle with a dressing made with olive oil, sherry vinegar and a teaspoon of pimentón.\n\n52. Chop hard-boiled eggs and mix with just enough mayonnaise to bind; spoon into endive leaves. Top each with a small canned sardine and drizzle with a vinaigrette of olive oil, lemon juice and mustard.\n\n53. Peel beets and grate them in a food processor. Mix equal parts plain yogurt and tahini, and toss with the beets along with lemon juice and zaatar (a mixture of toasted sesame seeds, dried green herbs and ground sumac; you can make it yourself using dried thyme).\n\n54. Slice roasted red peppers (if you must use canned, try to find piquillos) and fresh mozzarella. Toss with cooked white beans, olive oil, red wine vinegar, a chopped shallot and fresh rosemary or parsley.\n\nSALADS WITH SEAFOOD\n\n55. Mix watercress with chopped smoked salmon, avocado, red onion and capers. Make a vinaigrette with olive oil, sherry vinegar and mustard powder.\n\n56. Salade niçoise, sort of: On or around a bed of greens, make mounds of olives, cooked new potatoes and green beans (warm or at room temperature), good tomatoes, capers, fennel slivers, hard-cooked eggs and good quality Italian canned tuna. None of these is crucial; you get the idea. Serve with vinaigrette or aioli.\n\n57. Toss cubes of day-or-more-old good bread with soy sauce, chopped sautéed shrimp, chopped radishes and cilantro. Like a weird shrimp toast panzanella.\n\n58. Sear tuna until rare (for that matter, you could leave it raw) and cut it into small cubes. Toss with shredded jicama or radish and shredded Napa cabbage; season with mirin, soy sauce and cilantro. Avocado and/or wasabi paste are great with this, too.\n\n59. Sear tuna, or use good canned tuna. Chop it up and mix with chopped olives, capers, tomatoes, parsley and olive oil.\n\n60. Ditto on the tuna. Mix with chopped apples, halved seedless grapes, chopped red onion, olive oil, a bit of cumin and black pepper.\n\n61. Mix canned salmon (sockeye, or use cooked fresh) with capers, chopped celery, yogurt or mayonnaise, and lemon juice. Serve on greens or in endive leaves.\n\n62. Dust shrimp with chili powder. Sauté in butter or oil (or a combination) with fresh corn kernels and flavorful cooking greens (bok choy is good, as is watercress). Add halved cherry tomatoes and lime juice at the last minute.\n\n63. Sunday brunch salad: Mix diced cucumbers, chopped tomato, minced red onion and capers with bits of smoked salmon. Dress with lemon juice (you wont need much oil, if any). Take a step further by adding croutons of cubed toasted bagels.\n\n64. Alternative Sunday brunch: Shred or chop cucumbers (if theyre fat and old, peel and seed them first), then toss with flaked smoked trout or whitefish, capers, dill, lemon juice and olive oil.\n\n65. In a hot pan, flash-cook cut-up squid in a little olive oil for no more than two minutes. Toss with cooked or canned chickpeas, chopped bell peppers, lemon juice, a little more oil and parsley.\n\n66. In a hot pan, sear sea scallops for a minute or two on each side, depending on size. Slice or chop, then toss with thinly sliced fennel and lemon or orange vinaigrette and some chopped fennel fronds.\n\n67. Bread salad for anchovy lovers: Chop together many anchovies, a few capers, lemon juice and olive oil (or anchovy oil). Toss with cubes of toasted bread and chopped tomatoes or halved cherry or grape tomatoes.\n\n68. Mix crab meat with pan-roasted corn, chopped avocado, halved cherry or grape tomatoes, olive oil, lemon juice and perhaps a bit of cilantro and crumbled ancho chili.\n\n69. Stir-fry small or chopped shrimp in olive or peanut oil with lots of ginger; while still warm, combine with tomato wedges, chopped romaine, cilantro, scallions and lots of lime juice. Good in pita.\n\nSALADS WITH MEAT\n\n70. Shred brussels sprouts in the food processor, preferably with the slicing disk. Toss with vinaigrette and crumbled bacon.\n\n71. Combine sliced green tomatoes and sliced fresh mozzarella; top with roughly chopped basil, olive oil, black pepper and crumbled bacon.\n\n72. Sort-of carpaccio salad: Broil or grill skirt or sirloin steak very rare and slice very thin. Arrange on a plate with tomato wedges, lettuce and lemon juice.\n\n73. Hawaiitalian: Combine pineapple chunks with bits of any cured pork product  cooked guanciale is ideal, or any ham  and a not-too-subtle chili vinaigrette.\n\n74. Julienne red, yellow and orange bell peppers; mix with thinly sliced red onion, olive oil and cooked crumbled sausage or chopped salami.\n\n75. The Little Italy salad: Chop or julienne salami and prosciutto, then toss with cubed mozzarella, chopped tomato, pepperoncini, oil and wine vinegar.\n\n76. Slice fresh figs  many, if you live where they grow  and top with crumbled bacon, balsamic vinegar (the best you have) and crumbled blue cheese.\n\n77. Combine shredded cabbage or lettuce with bits of good turkey, Swiss cheese and rye croutons. Top with good old Russian dressing, call it a turkey sandwich salad and dont knock it until you try it.\n\n78. What happens when your Chicago hot dog falls apart: Toss together tomato wedges, chopped pickles, hot peppers, shredded lettuce and a few slices of broiled or grilled hot dog. Dress with a vinaigrette made with mustard (should be yellow for authenticity, but ...) and celery salt. (You could throw in freshly made croutons; inauthentic, but better than a hot dog bun.)\n\n79. Sear a steak and move it to a cutting board (dont wash the pan); wait a minute or two, then slice. Cut kale (preferably black, also known as Tuscan, or dino kale) into thin ribbons and toss in the pan over high heat for a minute. Turn off the heat, add chopped black olives, olive oil and sherry vinegar. Serve kale with steak on top.\n\n80. Sort-of-Cobb salad: Choose any combination of hard-cooked eggs, chopped prosciutto, cooked chicken, crumbled Gorgonzola, chopped tomatoes, chickpeas or white beans, sliced red onion, olives. Make vinaigrette with capers and anchovies.\n\n81. Soak sliced prune plums or figs in balsamic vinegar for a few minutes, then add olive oil, chopped celery and red onion, shreds of roasted or grilled chicken, chopped fresh marjoram or oregano and chopped almonds. Serve on top of or toss with greens. So good.\n\n82. Cut pancetta into matchsticks and crisp in a skillet with some oil, then caramelize onions in the fat. Toss both with chopped bitter greens  radicchio, escarole or endive, for example  toasted pine nuts and halved cherry or grape tomatoes.\n\n83. Toss thinly sliced Vidalia or other sweet onions with olive oil and red wine vinegar. Sear a skirt steak and let sit a minute; slice it thin. Toss salad greens with the onions, roasted red peppers, and steak; add a little more oil and vinegar if necessary.\n\nSALADS WITH NOODLES\n\n84. Spring rolls, unrolled: One at a time, soften a few sheets of rice paper in warm water. Drain, pat dry, cut into strips and toss with chopped cucumber, grated carrots, chopped cilantro, bean sprouts, chili flakes and chopped roasted peanuts. Dress with toasted sesame oil, fish sauce or soy sauce, and rice vinegar or lime juice. A few shrimp are a nice addition.\n\n85. Mix lots of arugula with somewhat less cold whole wheat penne, lemon zest, olive oil and Parmesan. The idea is an arugula salad with pasta, not a pasta salad with arugula.\n\n86. Toss chilled cooked soba noodles with diced cucumber (if theyre fat and old, peel and seed them first), a small amount of hijiki reconstituted with water, toasted sesame seeds and a vinaigrette laced with soy sauce and miso.\n\n87. Cold not-sesame noodles: Combine about a half-cup peanut butter with a tablespoon soy sauce and enough coconut milk to make the mixture creamy (about a half cup), along with garlic and chili flakes in a blender or food processor. Toss sauce with cooked and cooled noodles, a load of mint, Thai basil, and/or cilantro, and lime juice. Shredded cucumber and carrots optional.\n\n88. Toss cooked pasta with roasted red peppers, toasted walnuts, fresh goat cheese, basil and olive oil. Corny, but still good.\n\n89. Soak or cook rice noodles, drain and rinse; toss with cubed unripe mango, chopped peanuts, shredded carrot and minced scallion. Make a dressing of rice vinegar, fish sauce, lime juice, chili and a bit of sugar.\n\n90. Sort of classic pasta salad: Pasta, artichoke hearts, sliced prosciutto or salami, chopped plum tomato. Dress with olive oil and a bit of balsamic vinegar, perhaps with some mustard.\n\nGRAIN SALADS\n\n91. Cereal for grown-ups: Start with puffed brown rice; toss with chopped tomatoes, scallions, a minced chili, cooked or canned chickpeas and toasted unsweetened coconut. Dress with coconut milk and lime juice.\n\n92. Simmer a cup of bulgur and some roughly chopped cauliflower florets until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Toss with chopped tarragon, roughly chopped hazelnuts, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, olive oil and lemon juice.\n\n93. Mix leftover rice with lemon or lime juice, soy sauce and a combination of sesame and peanut oils. Microwave if necessary to soften the rice, then serve at room temperature, tossed with sprouts, shredded radishes, chopped scallions, bits of cooked meat or fish if you like and more soy sauce.\n\n94. Cook and cool quinoa. Toss with olive oil, loads of lemon juice, tons of parsley, some chopped tomatoes and, if you like, toasted pine nuts. Call it quinoa tabbouleh.\n\n95. Mix cooked couscous or quinoa with orange zest and juice, olive oil, maybe honey, sliced oranges, raisins or dried cranberries, chopped red onion and chopped almonds. Serve over greens, or not.\n\n96. Cook short-grain white rice in watered-down coconut milk (be careful that it doesnt burn) and a few cardamom pods. While warm, toss with peas (they can be raw if theyre fresh and tender), chopped cashews or pistachios, a pinch of chili flakes and chopped raw spinach.\n\n97. Toss cooked, cooled farro, wheat berries, barley or other chewy grain with chopped-up grapes. Add olive oil, lemon juice and thinly sliced romaine lettuce; toss again, with ricotta salata or feta if you want.\n\n98. Toss cooked bulgur with cooked chickpeas, quartered cherry or grape tomatoes, a little cumin, lots of chopped parsley, and lemon juice.\n\n99. Toss cooked quinoa with fresh sliced apricots, cherries, pecans, and enough lemon and black pepper to make the whole thing savory.\n\n100. Mash a canned chipotle with some of its adobo and stir with olive oil and lime juice. Toss with drained canned hominy, fresh corn cut from the cob (or drained pinto beans), cilantro and green onions.\n\n101. Cook a pot of short-grain rice. While its still hot, toss with raw grated zucchini, fermented black beans, sriracha, sesame oil, sake and a touch of rice vinegar. Add bits of leftover roast chicken or pork if you have it, and pass soy sauce at the table.',1,@cat6,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2009-07-22','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Add onions, carrot, and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until mixture is reddish brown, about 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons water and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is well browned, about 3 minutes, adding remaining water when needed to prevent scorching. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add wine and, using a heatproof rubber spatula, scrape up browned bits on bottom and sides of pot; bring to boil, stirring occasionally (mixture will thicken slightly).

If you are making sausage links, thoroughly rinse the casing of salt and soak it in a large pot of cold water overnight. Thoroughly rinse the casing again and place it in fresh, cold water until ready to use.\n\n2.	Attach the knife and grinding-plate attachments to a stand mixer. Run the pork and beef through the grinder into a large bowl, followed by a slice of bread to push out any bits of meat stuck inside the works. Discard any ground bread. Add the remaining ingredients and mix together with your hands. Knead the meat until it seizes up and holds together, about 2 minutes. At this point you can shape the sausage mixture into patties.\n\n3.	If you are making links, replace the grinding plate with a stuffer attachment with a ¾-inch opening. Select a length of casing and run water from the tap through it in order to clear out any excess salt and spot any holes, which you should trim out. Cut a length of casing at least 3 to 4 feet long; tie it off. Run the casing between your fingers to remove excess water. Stretch the open end of the casing around the attachments nozzle and gradually slide the rest of the casing onto the nozzle, an inch or 2 at a time. Leave about 3 inches at the knotted end dangling free. Put the sausage in the hopper of the grinder and turn it on (Speed 4 tends to work best). Hold the dangling casing with one hand, and with the other, feed the sausage mixture into the hopper with a wooden pestle at an even pace. When 2 inches of casing are empty at both the knotted and free ends, stop stuffing and slowly pull on the casing to free it from the stuffer nozzle. Run your fingers over the casing to distribute the sausage evenly. Pinch the middle of the sausage and gently twist it to form two long links. Keep pinching and twisting to form links 4 or 5 inches long. Repeat this process until all of the sausage meat has been used, pushing out the last bits of meat with another slice or two of bread.\n\n4.	Whether youve made patties or links, refrigerating the sausage overnight, wrapped in wax paper, will help it hold together as it cooks. To cook, snip off a single length containing as many individual sausages as you like. Dont separate the links until they have been cooked (in an oiled skillet, on the grill or under the broiler). Any uncooked remainders will freeze well. Makes 14 sausages.

INSERT INTO RECIPE (ID, TITLE, BODY, OWNER_ID, CATEGORY_ID, SUB_CATEGORY_ID, DATE_CREATED, VERSION) VALUES (seq_recipe.nextval,'Pumpkin Stuffed With Everything Good','npr.org ATC\nMakes 2 very generous servings\n\n1 pumpkin, about 3 pounds\n\nSalt and freshly ground pepper\n\n1/4 pound stale bread, thinly sliced and cut into 1/2-inch chunks\n\n1/4 pound cheese, such as Gruyere, Emmenthal, cheddar, or a combination, cut into 1/2-inch chunks\n\n24 garlic cloves (to taste), split, germ removed, and coarsely chopped\n\n4 strips bacon, cooked until crisp, drained, and chopped\n\nAbout 1/4 cup snipped fresh chives or sliced scallions\n\n1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme\n\nAbout 1/3 cup heavy cream\n\nPinch of freshly grated nutmeg\n\nCenter a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment, or find a Dutch oven with a diameter that\'s just a tiny bit larger than your pumpkin. If you bake the pumpkin in a casserole, it will keep its shape, but it might stick to the casserole, so you\'ll have to serve it from the pot  which is an appealingly homey way to serve it. If you bake it on a baking sheet, you can present it freestanding, but maneuvering a heavy stuffed pumpkin with a softened shell isn\'t so easy. However, since I love the way the unencumbered pumpkin looks in the center of the table, I\'ve always taken my chances with the baked-on-a-sheet method, and so far, I\'ve been lucky.\n\nUsing a very sturdy knife  and caution  cut a cap out of the top of the pumpkin (think Halloween jack-o\'-lantern). It\'s easiest to work your knife around the top of the pumpkin at a 45-degree angle. You want to cut off enough of the top to make it easy for you to work inside the pumpkin. Clear away the seeds and strings from the cap and from inside the pumpkin. Season the inside of the pumpkin generously with salt and pepper, and put it on the baking sheet or in the pot. Toss the bread, cheese, garlic, bacon, and herbs together in a bowl. Season with pepper  you probably have enough salt from the bacon and cheese, but taste to be sure  and pack the mix into the pumpkin. The pumpkin should be well filled  you might have a little too much filling, or you might need to add to it. Stir the cream with the nutmeg and some salt and pepper and pour it into the pumpkin. Again, you might have too much or too little  you don\'t want the ingredients to swim in cream, but you do want them nicely moistened. (But it\'s hard to go wrong here.)\n\nPut the cap in place and bake the pumpkin for about 2 hours  check after 90 minutes  or until everything inside the pumpkin is bubbling and the flesh of the pumpkin is tender enough to be pierced easily with the tip of a knife. Because the pumpkin will have exuded liquid, I like to remove the cap during the last 20 minutes or so, so that the liquid can bake away and the top of the stuffing can brown a little.\n\nWhen the pumpkin is ready, carefully, very carefully  it\'s heavy, hot, and wobbly  bring it to the table or transfer it to a platter that you\'ll bring to the table.\n\nServing\n\nYou have choices: you can cut wedges of the pumpkin and filling; you can spoon out portions of the filling, making sure to get a generous amount of pumpkin into the spoonful; or you can dig into the pumpkin with a big spoon, pull the pumpkin meat into the filling, and then mix everything up. I\'m a fan of the pull-and-mix option. Served in hearty portions followed by a salad, the pumpkin is a perfect cold-weather main course; served in generous spoonfuls or wedges, it\'s just right alongside the Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nStoring\n\nIt\'s really best to eat this as soon as it\'s ready. However, if you\'ve got leftovers, you can scoop them out of the pumpkin, mix them up, cover, and chill them; reheat them the next day.\n\nGreenspan\'s Stuffing Ideas\n\nThere are many ways to vary this arts-and-crafts project. Instead of bread, I\'ve filled the pumpkin with cooked rice  when it\'s baked, it\'s almost risotto-like. And, with either bread or rice, on different occasions I\'ve added cooked spinach, kale, chard, or peas (the peas came straight from the freezer). I\'ve made it without bacon, and I\'ve also made and loved, loved, loved it with cooked sausage meat; cubes of ham are another good idea. Nuts are a great addition, as are chunks of apple or pear or pieces of chestnut',1,@cat8,NULL,PARSEDATETIME('2010-11-15','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Place the turkey in the brine and seal, pressing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate for 12 to 20 hours, repositioning the turkey halfway through as needed to make sure the bird is evenly brined.\n\nRinse the turkey and pat it dry; discard the brine.\n\nFor the rub: Combine the sage, rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper in a small bowl.\n\nFor the bird: Soak the 2 cups of pecan or applewood chips for at least 1 hour.\n\nPrepare the grill for indirect heat: If using a charcoal grill, light the coals. Drain the water from the wood chips. If using a gas grill, place 1 cup of the chips in a smoker box or an aluminum foil pouch punctured with a fork on top to release smoke.\n\nIf using a charcoal grill, place a drip pan beneath the grates on the indirect side of the grill. When the coals are white-hot, scatter 1 cup of the wood chips directly onto the coals. If using a gas grill, place a drip pan directly on the flavorizer bars, briquettes or lava rocks. Place the smoker box or foil pouch between the grate and briquettes, close to the flame. Preheat on high until you see smoke, then reduce the heat to medium (350 degrees).\n\nCoat the cavity and skin of the turkey with butter. Coat the cavity with 2 tablespoons of the rub, then use the remainder of the rub to coat the buttered skin of the bird. Place the onion, apple and fennel pieces in the cavity.\n\nPlace the turkey, breast side up, on the indirect side of the grill, over the drip pan. Cover the charcoal grill and leave the vents open. Close the lid of the gas grill.\n\nAfter 1 hour, add a dozen briquettes and the remaining cup of chips directly onto the charcoal fire. If using a gas grill, add the remaining chips to the smoker box or remove the foil pouch and replace it with a second pouch. Baste the turkey with drippings every 20 minutes until it is done.\n\nAfter 2 hours, insert a meat thermometer into thickest part of the breast without touching the bone. The bird is done when the temperature reads 170 degrees (between 2 and 3 hours).\n\nTransfer the turkey to a cutting board. Discard the onion mixture in the cavity, if desired. Let the bird rest for 15 minutes before carving.\n\nRecipe Source:\nFrom Smoke Signals columnist Jim Shahin.\n\n480 calories, 23g fat, 7g saturated fat, 185mg cholesterol, 1590mg sodium, 2g carbohydrates, n/a dietary fiber, 1g sugar, 62g protein.',1,@cat4,@subcat10,PARSEDATETIME('2010-11-17','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Published March 1, 2010.   From Cook\'s Illustrated.\n\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nTo devise a properly chewy brownie recipe, we first had to discover the perfect ratio of oil to butter. We then combated greasiness by replacing some of the oil with egg yolks, whose emulsifiers prevent fat from separating and leaking out duri...(more)\n\nFor the chewiest texture, it is important to let the brownies cool thoroughly before cutting. If your baking dish is glass, cool the brownies 10 minutes, then remove them promptly from the pan (otherwise, the superior heat retention of glass can lead to overbaking). While any high-quality chocolate can be used in this recipe, our preferred brands of bittersweet chocolate are Callebaut Intense Dark Chocolate L-60-40NV and Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar. Our preferred brand of unsweetened chocolate is Scharffen Berger. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1/3cup Dutch-processed cocoa\n1 1/2teaspoons instant espresso (optional)\n1/2cup plus 2 tablespoons boiling water\n2ounces unsweetened chocolate , finely chopped (see note and related illustration)\n4tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter , melted\n1/2cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n2large eggs\n2 large egg yolks\n2teaspoons vanilla extract\n2 1/2cups (17 1/2 ounces) sugar\n1 3/4cups (8 3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour\n3/4teaspoon table salt\n6ounces bittersweet chocolate , cut into 1/2-inch pieces (see note)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Referring to directions in Making a Foil Sling (related), make sling using the following steps: Cut 18-inch length foil and fold lengthwise to 8-inch width. Fit foil into length of 13 by 9-inch baking pan, pushing it into corners and up sides of pan; allow excess to overhang pan edges. Cut 14-inch length foil and fit into width of pan in the same manner, perpendicular to the first sheet (if using extra-wide foil, fold second sheet lengthwise to 12-inch width). Spray with nonstick cooking spray.\n\n2. Whisk cocoa, espresso powder (if using), and boiling water together in large bowl until smooth. Add unsweetened chocolate and whisk until chocolate is melted. Whisk in melted butter and oil. (Mixture may look curdled.) Add eggs, yolks, and vanilla and continue to whisk until smooth and homogeneous. Whisk in sugar until fully incorporated. Add flour and salt and mix with rubber spatula until combined. Fold in bittersweet chocolate pieces.\n\n3. Scrape batter into prepared pan and bake until toothpick inserted halfway between edge and center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 30 to 35 minutes.

Use an oven mitt or dish towel to safely grip and maneuver the hot bricks. If youre using table salt, reduce the amount to 1½ teaspoons in step 2. You will need two standard-sized bricks for this recipe. Placing the bricks on the chicken while it cooks ensures that the skin will be evenly browned and well rendereddont skip this step. A cast-iron skillet or other heavy pan can be used in place of the bricks.\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil\n8 medium garlic cloves , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 1/2 tablespoons)\n1 teaspoon finely grated zest from 1 lemon , plus 2 tablespoons juice\n  Pinch crushed red pepper flakes\n4 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves\n3 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary\n  Kosher salt (see note)\n  Ground black pepper\n1 (3 3/4- to 4 1/4-pound) whole chicken (see note)\n  Vegetable oil for cooking grate\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Combine oil, garlic, lemon zest, and pepper flakes in small saucepan. Bring to simmer, stirring frequently, over medium-low heat, about 3 minutes. Once simmering, add 3 teaspoons thyme and 2 teaspoons rosemary and cook 30 seconds longer. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over small bowl, pushing on solids to extract oil. Transfer solids to small bowl and cool; set oil and solids aside.\n\n2. Butterfly chicken, flatten breastbone, and tuck wings behind back. Using hands or handle of wooden spoon, loosen skin over breast and thighs and remove any excess fat. Combine 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in small bowl. Mix 3 teaspoons salt mixture with cooled garlic solids. Spread salt-garlic mixture evenly under skin over chicken breast and thighs. Sprinkle remaining teaspoon salt mixture on exposed meat of bone side. Place chicken skin-side up on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.\n\n3. Wrap 2 bricks tightly in aluminum foil. Light large chimney starter filled three-quarters with charcoal (4½ quarts, or about 75 briquettes) and burn until coals are covered with layer of fine gray ash, about 20 minutes. Build modified two-level fire by arranging all coals over half of grill, leaving other half empty. Position cooking grate over coals, place bricks on grate over coals, cover grill, and heat about 5 minutes. Scrape cooking grate clean with grill brush. Lightly dip wad of paper towels in vegetable oil; holding wad with tongs, wipe cooking grate. Grill is ready when side with coals is medium-hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above grate for 3 to 4 seconds).\n\n4. Place chicken skin-side down over cooler side of grill with legs facing fire, place hot bricks lengthwise over each breast half, cover grill, and cook until skin is lightly browned and faint grill marks appear, 22 to 25 minutes. Remove bricks from chicken. Using tongs or towel, grip legs and flip chicken (chicken should release freely from grill; use thin metal spatula to loosen if stuck) and transfer to hot side of grill, skin-side up, with breast facing center of grill. Place bricks over breast, cover grill, and cook until chicken is well browned, 12 to 15 minutes.\n\n5. Remove bricks, flip chicken skin-side down over hot coals, and cook until chicken skin is well crisped and instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes, moving chicken as necessary to prevent flare-ups. Transfer chicken to cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Whisk lemon juice and remaining thyme and rosemary into reserved oil; season with salt and pepper. Carve chicken and serve, passing sauce separately.',1,@cat4,@subcat9,PARSEDATETIME('2011-05-21','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

INSERT INTO RECIPE (ID, TITLE, BODY, OWNER_ID, CATEGORY_ID, SUB_CATEGORY_ID, DATE_CREATED, VERSION) VALUES (seq_recipe.nextval,'Steak Tacos','Serves 4 to 6.   Published September 1, 2008.   From Cook\'s Illustrated.\n\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nTo develop a steak taco recipe with an indoor cooking method that yielded steak taco meat as tender, juicy, and rich-tasting as the grilled method, we chose flank steak, beefy and tender when sliced thinly across the grain. Pan-searing gave us the browned exterior and crisp, brittle edges characteristic of grilled meat. A paste of oil, cilantro, scallions, garlic, and jalapeño applied to the meat and scraped off just before cooking gave our steak taco recipe a flavor boost without sacrificing browning.\n\nFor a less spicy dish, remove some or all of the ribs and seeds from the jalapeños before chopping them for the marinade. In addition to the toppings suggested below, try serving the tacos with Sweet and Spicy Pickled Onions, thinly sliced radishes or cucumber, or salsa.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS\nHerb Paste\n1/2 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves\n3 medium garlic cloves , roughly chopped\n3 medium scallions , roughly chopped (about 1/3 cup)\n1 medium jalapeño chile , stemmed and roughly chopped (see note)\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/4 cup vegetable oil\n1 tablespoon fresh lime juice\n\nSteak\n1 flank steak (1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds), trimmed of excess fat and cut lengthwise (with grain) into 4 equal pieces (see below)\n1 tablespoon kosher salt or 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt\n1/2 teaspoon sugar\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\nTacos\n\n12 (6-inch) corn tortillas , warmed (see note)\nFresh cilantro leaves\nMinced white or red onion\nLime wedges\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. FOR THE HERB PASTE: Pulse cilantro, garlic, scallions, jalapeño, and cumin in food processor until finely chopped, ten to twelve 1-second pulses, scraping down sides as necessary. Add oil and process until mixture is smooth and resembles pesto, about 15 seconds, scraping down sides of workbowl as necessary. Transfer 2 tablespoons herb paste to medium bowl; whisk in lime juice and set aside.\n\n2. FOR THE STEAK: Using dinner fork, poke each piece of steak 10 to 12 times on each side. Place in large baking dish; rub all sides of steak pieces evenly with salt and then coat with remaining herb paste. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.\n\n3. Scrape herb paste off steak and sprinkle all sides of pieces evenly with sugar and pepper. Heat oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until smoking. Place steak in skillet and cook until well browned, about 3 minutes. Flip steak and sear until second side is well browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Using tongs, stand each piece on a cut side and cook, turning as necessary, until all cut sides are well browned and internal temperature registers 125 to 130 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 2 to 7 minutes. Transfer steak to cutting board and let rest 5 minutes.\n\n4. FOR THE TACOS: Using sharp chefs knife or carving knife, slice steak pieces across grain into 1/8-inch-thick pieces. Transfer sliced steak to bowl with herb paste-lime juice mixture and toss to coat. Season with salt. Spoon small amount of sliced steak into center of each warm tortilla and serve immediately, passing toppings separately.\n\nSHOPPING\nCorn Tortillas for Tacos\n\nThe rule of thumb when buying tortillas is to buy a brand made with nothing more than ground corn treated with lime (an alkali that removes the germ and hull) and water. Look for brands sold in the refrigerator case of the supermarket, as these have few, if any, preservatives and tend to be more moist and flavorful.',1,@cat4,@subcat1,PARSEDATETIME('2011-09-24','yyyy-MM-dd'),0);

Put the chicken, the beef bones if youre using them, 3 of the onion quarters and the garlic in a large pot. Add water just to cover (about 10 cups) and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat so the liquid bubbles gently. Cook, skimming the foam off the surface every now and then, until the chicken is very tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n\n2. Meanwhile, put the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, fry 2 of the tortillas (one at a time if necessary), turning once, until crisp and golden, 2 to 3 minutes per tortilla. Drain on paper towels. Cut the 4 remaining tortillas into strips, add them to the skillet and fry, stirring to separate them, until crisp and golden, another 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt while theyre still warm.\n\n3. When the chicken is tender, transfer it to a plate or cutting board with tongs or a slotted spoon (or put it in the fridge or freezer so it cools faster). When its cool enough to handle, shred the meat with your fingers, discarding the bones and the skin. (If you used beef, discard it or save it for another use.)\n\n4. While the chicken is cooling, strain the stock and discard the solids. Peel the remaining quarter of an onion and put it in a blender with the chipotle, 1/4 cup of the cilantro and a sprinkle of salt. Crumble in the two whole fried tortillas and add enough stock to fill the blender a little more than halfway. Purée until the mixture is as smooth as possible.\n\n5. Pour the purée and remaining stock back into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat so the mixture bubbles gently and cook for 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the shredded chicken, taste and add more salt if necessary. Divide the avocados, the cheese and the remaining 1/4 cup cilantro among 4 to 6 bowls.

Published March 1, 2010.   From Cook\'s Illustrated.\n\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nTo devise a properly chewy brownie recipe, we first had to discover the perfect ratio of oil to butter. We then combated greasiness by replacing some of the oil with egg yolks, whose emulsifiers prevent fat from separating and leaking out during baking. We found that unsweetened chocolate provides the strongest chocolate flavor. Finally, folding in bittersweet chocolate chunks just before baking gave our chewy brownies gooey pockets of melted chocolate and rounded out their complex flavor.\n\nFor the chewiest texture, it is important to let the brownies cool thoroughly before cutting. If your baking dish is glass, cool the brownies 10 minutes, then remove them promptly from the pan (otherwise, the superior heat retention of glass can lead to overbaking). While any high-quality chocolate can be used in this recipe, our preferred brands of bittersweet chocolate are Callebaut Intense Dark Chocolate L-60-40NV and Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar. Our preferred brand of unsweetened chocolate is Scharffen Berger. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1/3 cup Dutch-processed cocoa\n1 1/2 teaspoons instant espresso (optional)\n1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons boiling water\n2 ounces unsweetened chocolate , finely chopped (see note)\n4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter , melted\n1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n2 large eggs\n2 large egg yolks\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n2 1/2 cups (17 1/2 ounces) sugar\n1 3/4 cups (8 3/4 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour\n3/4 teaspoon table salt\n6 ounces bittersweet chocolate , cut into 1/2-inch pieces (see note)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Referring to directions in Making a Foil Sling (related), make sling using the following steps: Cut 18-inch length foil and fold lengthwise to 8-inch width. Fit foil into length of 13 by 9-inch baking pan, pushing it into corners and up sides of pan; allow excess to overhang pan edges. Cut 14-inch length foil and fit into width of pan in the same manner, perpendicular to the first sheet (if using extra-wide foil, fold second sheet lengthwise to 12-inch width). Spray with nonstick cooking spray.\n\n2. Whisk cocoa, espresso powder (if using), and boiling water together in large bowl until smooth. Add unsweetened chocolate and whisk until chocolate is melted. Whisk in melted butter and oil. (Mixture may look curdled.) Add eggs, yolks, and vanilla and continue to whisk until smooth and homogeneous. Whisk in sugar until fully incorporated. Add flour and salt and mix with rubber spatula until combined. Fold in bittersweet chocolate pieces.\n\n3. Scrape batter into prepared pan and bake until toothpick inserted halfway between edge and center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 30 to 35 minutes.
